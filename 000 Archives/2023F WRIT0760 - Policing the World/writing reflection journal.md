# Steps
Review the work you have done for the modules. What was the most challenging work and why? Consider declarative (what you needed to know), affective (emotionally), and procedural knowledge (planning and implementing) issues.

How did the challenges connect to what you already knew prior to this class or had already learned? Were you able to build upon that prior knowledge and how? How did this challenge differ from what you already knew how to do?

What do you think you learned from this challenge about yourself and writing?

Take notes on what looks new and familiar in the modules. Note whenever you find yourself in a situation you cannot address with your current level of skills.

## Declarative Skills
I'm not sure what informal logic is and how it differs from other kinds of reasonings. What are other reasonings - the narrative and poetic reasoning? Why is it important in academic writing?

I think I understand what logical structures of writing is. Like evidence and claims, or problem and solution organization? I think I have a firm grasp of writing a strong thesis, but no idea about logical and semantic coherence.

I do know about the major logical fallacies because of Anki, but I think I have difficult recognizing them in text in realtime.

I don't know about elements of a logical outline.

## Procedural Skills
I don't know the elements of informal logic, and thus I do not know about organizing and validating academic writing. I think I can create logical outlines of writing though, and how to use it to generate a larger draft. I haven't used outlines to check my final draft though, or to use it to advance my understanding.

I cannot identify or correct logical or semantic incoherence or recognize logical fallacies.

## Conditional Skills
I think I have a good grasp on how much time and detail I put into my outlines, and knowing whether I should start my outline with the information I know.

I do not know when or whether to use justificatory, explanatory, narrative, or poetic reasoning in a particular circumstance. Or which reasons are most compelling.

## Affective Skills
I'm good with all the topics mentioned under the Affective section. I can ask help, and I understand how to get through difficult material.
