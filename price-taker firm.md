Has a [[price elasticity of demand]] of $\infty$, and thus has a horizontal demand curve.

Has no market power and its [[marginal revenue]] = price.

The break-even price is the minimum of the [[average costs|average total cost curve]] where the MC = ATC.

The shut-down price is when the profit-maximizing quantity at $MR = MC$ will be such that $P \leq AVC$.
- Thus, for a perfectly competitive price-taker firm, the shut-down price is the minimum of the AVC where AVC = MC
