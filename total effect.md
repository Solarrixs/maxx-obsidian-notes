Total effect = [[substitution effects]] + [[income effects]]
- The substitution effect makes the [[budget line]] flatter through the $\frac{P_{X}}{P_{Y}}$ equation
- The income effect increases purchasing power and shifts the budget line right

The total effect is the observed change in consumption of a good after price changes.

The total effect generates a phantom budget line:
- Has the slope of the new budget line after total effects
- Tangent to the initial [[indifference curve]] at the "phantom point"
- Change from the initial consumption point to the phantom point: **substitution effect**
- Change from the "phantom point" to the new consumption point: **income effect**
