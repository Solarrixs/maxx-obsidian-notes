Total utility increases by the sum of marginal utility.
- ! However, marginal utility decreases after subsequent consumption of goods or services. This is known as diminishing marginal utility. So higher consumption means decreasing marginal utility. This is because the ratio of $MU_{x}:MU_{y}$ is decreasing and thus it is a diminishing marginal utility and a convex curve on the [[indifference curve]].

Marginal utility can be written as $MU_{x}$ and $MU_{y}$ for a bundle. The quantity of an item in a bundle is written as $\Delta Q_{x}$ and $\Delta Q_{y}$. Thus: $-MU_{x} \times \Delta Q_{x} = MU_{y}\times\Delta Q_{y}$
- The loss of good Y times someone's marginal utility of Y should be equal to the gain of good X times someone's marginal utility of X

There can be perfect substitutes of marginal utility, leading to a constant slope and not a convex slope.

There can be perfect complements of marginal utility - the utility of one good depends on it being used with another good. These are L shaped. Consumer's utility only rises when they have more of both goods in the same proportion. The [[marginal rate of substitution]] ($MRS_{xy}$) becomes either infinity, 0, or undefined.
