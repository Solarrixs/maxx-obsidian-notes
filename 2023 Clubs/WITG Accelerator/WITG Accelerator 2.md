3 statements that provide snapshot into company financials:
- IS - income statement, profit and loss or revenue and expenses- over period of time annually or quarterly. Assesses profitability.
- BS - balance sheet, assets, liabilities, shareholder equity- point in time that shows financial position of a business
- SCF - cash flow statement, cash inflows and outflows, cash from operating, investing, and financing, expressed over a period of time. Shows net change from start to end, or cash movements of a period

# IS
revenues and expenses are recorded when they are incurred not when cash actually exchanges hands

Starts with:
Revenue
- - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
	- COGS is the cost for the materials that went directly into inventory that was sold to generate your revenue (so if you spent costs making something and it hasn't been sold yet, it's not in COGS)
	- COGS = cost to make x volume
	- gross profit = revenue - COGS
	- Gross margin = gross profit/revenue

Gross Profit
- - Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) - rent, utilities, marketing and advertising, sales and accounting, management and administrative salaries
- - R&D
- - Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)
	- depreciation - decrease in value of something tangible over time like machines
	- amortization - decrease in value of something intangible over time like patents

These are all operating expenses, costs needed to operate your business
operating margin = EBIT (operating income)/ Revenue

Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT/Operating Profit)
- - Interest Expense (capital expenses)

doesn't include capital structure or subsidies, but allows one to see pure company revenue

Earnings Before Taxes (EBT)
- - Taxes (jurisdiction the business operates)

Net Income (NI, Earnings)
- + income

## Revenue
revenue is the money you make, but you don't need to have this money directly in hand. revenue doesn't include expenses but is users in a given period multiplied by the amount each user might pay $P \times Q$
- selling price x units sold
- contract value x # of customers
- loan value x interest rate

the revenue is generally modeled by a company's business models
- retail, subscription, fee-for-service, marketplace, rental, franchise, razor-razorblade, lending, utilization
