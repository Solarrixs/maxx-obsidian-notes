3 statements that provide snapshot into company financials:
- IS - income statement, profit and loss or revenue and expenses- over period of time annually or quarterly. Assesses profitability.
- BS - balance sheet, assets, liabilities, shareholder equity- point in time that shows financial position of a business
- SCF - cash flow statement, cash inflows and outflows, cash from operating, investing, and financing, expressed over a period of time. Shows net change from start to end, or cash movements of a period

# Income Statement
revenues and expenses are recorded when they are incurred not when cash actually exchanges hands

Starts with:
Revenue
- - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
	- COGS is the cost for the materials that went directly into inventory that was sold to generate your revenue (so if you spent costs making something and it hasn't been sold yet, it's not in COGS)
	- COGS = cost to make x volume
	- gross profit = revenue - COGS
	- Gross margin = gross profit/revenue

Gross Profit
- - Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) - rent, utilities, marketing and advertising, sales and accounting, management and administrative salaries
- - R&D
- - Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)
	- depreciation - decrease in value of something tangible over time like machines
	- amortization - decrease in value of something intangible over time like patents

These are all operating expenses, costs needed to operate your business
operating margin = EBIT (operating income)/ Revenue

Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT/Operating Profit)
- - Interest Expense (capital expenses)

doesn't include capital structure or subsidies, but allows one to see pure company revenue
Interest expense is any interest for any debt or money borrowed. Debt doesn't come with equity, so when capital is returned, it is worth more for a business.

Earnings Before Taxes (EBT)
- - Taxes (jurisdiction the business operates), around 21%

Net Income (NI, Earnings)
- + income

## Revenue
revenue is the money you make, but you don't need to have this money directly in hand. revenue doesn't include expenses but is users in a given period multiplied by the amount each user might pay $P \times Q$
- selling price x units sold
- contract value x # of customers
- loan value x interest rate

the revenue is generally modeled by a company's business models
- retail, subscription, fee-for-service, marketplace, rental, franchise, razor razor-blade, lending, utilization

# Balance Sheet
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Everything the firm owns = everything the firm owes + residual claims

Is a snapshot of a company at a given time

## Assets
Resource with economic value right now or in the future: assets should increase revenue or decrease costs and have a probable and measurable economic benefit

Recorded at its historical price

Assets divided into two groups
Current assets: short-term assets of <1 year that can be liquidated into cash quickly
- cash and cash equivalents
- inventory
- prepaid expenses
Non-current assets: have a useful life of >1 year
- land
- buildings/capital equipment
- intangible
- accumulated depreciation

## Liabilities
Claims on assets of the business
A responsibility to provide an asset or service in the future
Used to fund assets

Liabilities are divided into two groups:
- current liabilities due in <1 year like accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses or debt in general
- non-current liabilities due in >1 year like long term debt
- shareholder's equity is their claim on assets after ll debts owed are paid like common stock or retained earnings

# Balance Sheet
plant property and equipment (PP&E) is the physical and tangible long term assets with 1+ year expected life like buildings, land, equipment, or vehicles

PP&E is a non current asset

Beginning Net PP&E
- - Depreciation (expense on income statement)
- + Capital Expenditures (cash flow from financing)
= Ending Net PP&E
