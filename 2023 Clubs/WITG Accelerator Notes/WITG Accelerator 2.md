- **IS (Income Statement)**: Assesses profitability by showing revenue and expenses over a period (annually or quarterly).
- **BS (Balance Sheet)**: Snapshot of financial position at a point in time, showing assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity.
- **SCF (Statement of Cash Flows)**: Shows cash inflows and outflows from operations, investing, and financing over a period.

## Real World Use Cases
- **IS (Income Statement)**
    - **Real-World Example**: Suppose an investor is considering investing in two competing tech startups—Startup A and Startup B. Both have similar products and market opportunities. By examining their income statements, the investor notices that Startup A has significantly higher operating margins and lower expenses compared to Startup B. This information signals that Startup A is more efficient in converting revenue to profit, making it a potentially better investment.
    - **Importance**: The income statement helps stakeholders understand a company's ability to generate profit, manage expenses, and grow over time. It serves as a report card for the company’s financial performance over a specific period.

- **BS (Balance Sheet)**
    - **Real-World Example**: A venture capital firm is deciding between funding two SaaS companies. Company X has strong assets in the form of cash and intellectual property but also high short-term liabilities. Company Y has fewer assets but little to no debt. By examining the balance sheets, the VC firm can assess which company is more financially stable and better positioned for long-term success.
    - **Importance**: The balance sheet provides a snapshot of what a company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities), as well as the residual ownership (equity). It's crucial for assessing a company's liquidity and capital structure, which in turn affects its risk and return profile.

- **SCF (Statement of Cash Flows)**
    - **Real-World Example**: An internal auditor at a manufacturing company notices a discrepancy between net income and cash from operating activities. Upon closer examination, they find that while the company shows a profit on the income statement, the cash flow statement reveals a negative cash flow from operations due to large outlays for inventory. This prompts an internal review, leading to a change in inventory management strategy to improve cash flow.
    - **Importance**: Cash is king in business. The statement of cash flows provides insights into a company’s cash position, which is essential for operations and investment opportunities. It complements the income statement and balance sheet by showing how money moves in and out of the business, providing a more comprehensive view of financial health.
