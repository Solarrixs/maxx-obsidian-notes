Everyday, I use fintech services like Stripe for my startup or enjoy the convenience of contactless payments. It's clear how fintech has revolutionized lives worldwide. Joining WUFT would allow me to explore its depth and potential impacts on startups.

With a background as a programmer, startup founder, and stock trader, I have a good blend of finance and tech experience. My journey includes raising $100k (pre-seed round) as a market analyst, running 2 small businesses, and staying updated with Hacker News. I believe this makes me a great fit for the WUFT community.

For me, FinTech is a mix of tradition and innovation - infusing old commerce systems with digital technology, focusing on convenience and accessibility.

Take Robinhood. Although it received major flak during the GME squeeze, Robinhood pioneered commission-free trades for all, forcing other brokerage firms to eliminate their trading commissions. Now, stock trading is convenient and accessible to average traders like you and me.

It's innovations like this that have made me incredibly passionate about fintech. As someone invested in entrepreneurship, I hope to leverage DeFi crowdfunding technology to fund student research projects, a problem I personally faced.
