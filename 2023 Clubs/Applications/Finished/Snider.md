Bioengineering & Engineering Entrepreneurship

No two startups or companies are exactly the same, but what has become increasingly clear to me is that there is common ground among all successful companies. I'm curious as to what that common ground is.

Curious enough to dive into startups head-on.

Two years ago, I started a badminton stringing service. Despite decent profits, I spent a ton of time on it and learned about the importance of scalability. Last year, I founded a tutoring company with a projected ARR of $4,000, but I wasn't passionate about it and stopped the company. I learned that passionate founders are the heart of companies. And this year, I did market research for a startup in a field I've had experience in for five years and helped them raise $100,000 pre-seed from the 1517 Fund. I learned that product-market fit is crucial to success.

But I'm still learning what that common ground is and now, what I want to build in the future.

Becoming a consultant at Snider Consulting presents a golden opportunity to bridge my engineering background with financial and business insights. It is also an environment where I can iterate fast (and learn fast) about successful companies and what I want to build in the future. To me, consulting is the best way to learn about how companies succeed without needing to start your own to learn.

If I am accepted into Snider Consulting, I won't join any other time-intensive club, especially consulting-related ones. Snider is the only professionally-managed consulting experience, and therefore I expect to learn so much more at Snider than any other consulting club could offer. Finally, as my values align with Snider, this would be an opportunity, not a burden, for both personal and professional growth.

One project I'm passionate about is neuromorphic computing chips.

Having done five years of research on neuron functionality and memory processes, I've realized that your brain lends itself extremely well to building powerful and energy-efficient computers. Your brain learns extremely quickly and is also hyper-efficient. Competing on Jeopardy requires your brain to access 20W of electricity, while it requires IBM Watson 20,000 watts.

This technology, I believe, will change the world. Major data servers' electricity costs will drop by literally 200%, enabling greater big data capabilities. AI inherently mimics human neurons (hence artificial neural networks), but what if AI ran on actual neurons? And hyper-efficient information processing would massively benefit high-complexity simulations - finance, healthcare, and aerospace, to name a few.

And I hope that after seven semesters at Snider, I will have a breadth of knowledge from the different industries I consulted for and the depth of knowledge on how and why some startups succeed to successfully start my own company that I'll be passionate about.

Sincerely, Maxx Yung
