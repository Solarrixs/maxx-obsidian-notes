# Moso Capital Application

**Describe yourself in three words.**
Driven, Analytical, Entrepreneurial

**Why are you interested in VC?**
I'm drawn to VC because it resonates with my entrepreneurial spirit. Having started my own startup, I want to understand and learn what makes a startup successful. What metrics are tracked? What values are prioritized? By joining the VC space at Moso Capital, I see an opportunity to benefit:
1. Myself, by understanding what, why, and how some startups succeed and why 99% fail.
2. The Moso Capital team, by contributing my unique insights in biotechnology (having conducted 5 years of biotech-related research) and startup experience, and by bringing my analytical skills and financial literacy.

**What is ONE factor to evaluate a startup, what would it be and why?**
I'd evaluate a startup's growth rate (not growth!)

Growth is "+10 users/month." Growth rate is "2x users/month."

Why growth rate? Because a company growing 1% weekly grows 1.7x yearly. At 5%, it's 12.6x yearly.

This tiny change dictates whether a company dominates a market or struggles afloat.

**Case Study**
Concrete production used by the construction industry is responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions. To lessen concrete’s environmental impact, Carbon Limit, a Florida-based company founded in 2020, seeks to significantly reduce concrete's carbon footprint.

Their product, CaptureCrete, is a unique and inexpensive product created by utilizing a natural mineral-based admixture that can be incorporated or retrofitted into any concrete mix. The minerals within the admixture captures atmospheric CO2 permanently as the concrete cures, reducing the carbon footprint of construction projects by up to 75%. Independently verified by the Carbon Trust, it not only absorbs CO2 but also demonstrates improved performance over time, including self-healing properties that extend the lifespan of concrete infrastructures.

In its initial two years, Carbon Limit secured over $1.89 million in pre-seed funding to expand production and distribution, meeting the increasing demand for sustainable building materials. Having won prestigious awards such as the Smart Construction Innovation World Cup and the CEMEX Ventures Construction Startup Competition, the firm demonstrates their unique value proposition, indicating promising future prospects and investor confidence.

Carbon Limit has formed strategic partnerships with major construction companies to enhance its market presence and integrate CaptureCrete into mainstream building practices. Such collaborations include projects with Bechtel at the new Googleplex site, and residential and commercial ventures in Sweden with Skanska. Pilot projects are also underway, with the Minnesota Department of Transportation testing 35 pavement mixes with CaptureCrete at a U.S. interstate, followed by a three-year case study. These collaborations validate Carbon Limit's technology and showcase its commercial potential.

Despite being an early-stage company with limited revenue and profitability (undisclosed financials), I believe Carbon Limit is poised for growth in the carbon capture and storage (CCS) market, which is projected to expand from $2.5 billion in 2022 to $18.3 billion by 2030. Carbon Limit stands out for its inexpensive technology and adaptability to existing structures. Environmental pressures on the construction industry further escalate demand for CarbonCrete.

Carbon Limit also plans to expand CaptureCrete to include applications in asphalt, bricks, and mortar, positioning itself as a leader in the CCS market due to its cost-effective and versatile technology that is protected by three patents. Steering the company towards this goal is a management team with huge industry experience; CEO Tim Sperry and CTO Oro Padron boast decades of tech industry experience, while COO Christina Stavridi has 15 years of expertise in managing large-scale construction projects, having held senior roles at Bechtel and Skanska.

Carbon Limit is a standout company offering a validated solution to the environmental issues tied to concrete production. CaptureCrete significantly reduces the carbon footprint of construction projects and enhances the durability of concrete structures. Strong partnerships with industry leaders led by a team with deep backgrounds in tech and construction, the company has demonstrated substantial market viability and growth potential. Taking into account Carbon Limit’s ambitious expansion plans in the blooming CCS market, I recommend sourcing this company to our venture partner.
