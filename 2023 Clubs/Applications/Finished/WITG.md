**Why do you want to join WITG?**
Inspired by my dad's daily engagement with stock news, I began stock trading during the pandemic. While I purchased stocks at random, I saw my father drawing lines and reading a company's balance sheet. It looked complicated to me, so I didn't try to learn anything in-depth and just focused on understanding basic fundamentals (P/E ratio, market cap, AGR) and analyzing technical indicators (MACD, RSI, BB bands) with Python. Now that I'm at Penn and more interested in business, I'm hoping WITG will teach me everything I need to understand CNBC on the radio with my dad!

**Pitch a publicly traded company and tell us why you believe it would make a good investment. You may choose to focus on qualitatively evaluating the business model, industry structure, competitive advantages, and potential risks, but otherwise feel free to use the space as you deem fit. Use the same pitch if you apply to two investment teams (you can apply to at most two investment teams). More guidelines can be found on our website at www.pennwitg.com. (500 words)**
The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NASDAQ: TSM) is the world's leading semiconductor foundry, manufacturing the world’s most advanced chips for many major tech companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Currently (September 2023), TSM is trading at $91.14 per share, but I believe this company is still undervalued and is well-positioned to capitalize on future artificial intelligence or biotech trends.

Led by semiconductor leaders Dr. Liu and Dr. Wei, and a management team boasting an average of 20 years in the sector, TSM continuously innovates in semiconductor manufacturing technology, maintaining a dominant industry position. This is signified by a mere 0.5% short interest in its shares. With a market capitalization of about $453 billion and a P/E ratio of 14.74, TSM is the world's largest and most profitable semiconductor manufacturer. Yet, TSM’s growth and dominance are expected to continue with the forthcoming boom in the artificial intelligence and biotechnology sectors.

TSM maintains its industry dominance through substantial assets, including a net PP&E valued at $94 billion, signifying vast tangible assets to build more efficient and sustainable high-volume semiconductor foundries, surpassing competitors. This competitive advantage is reflected in the company's gross margin of over 60% and a net income of $6.2 billion, demonstrating substantial profitability. Furthermore, TSM generates $51 billion of cash while holding $53 billion in cash reserves, allowing TSM the flexibility to reinvest into their foundries and improve manufacturing technologies.

For example, just last December in 2022, TSM unveiled its 3nm chips, which hold 60% higher transistor density and 35% lower power consumption than current 5nm chips. As one of few companies manufacturing 3nm chips for the foreseeable future, this will reinforce TSM’s substantial market stronghold and continued market dominance. Just last month, TSM began mass-producing 3nm chips following a contract with Apple for iPhone 15 chips, highlighting TSM's status as a favored partner for global tech giants like Apple and Nvidia.

Finally, TSM is investing $40 billion to set up a new manufacturing hub in Arizona. This initiative aligns with the 2021 CHIPS and Science Act, in which the US plans to rejuvenate the domestic semiconductor sector. As such, a notable $52.7 billion fund was sanctioned for this sector, which consequently would increase demand for TSM’s chip. This initiative also extends TSM’s customer reach in the US, potentially securing agreements with emerging tech giants. Moreover, by spreading its manufacturing bases beyond Taiwan, TSM lessens geopolitical vulnerabilities (especially China), thus enhancing the firm's resilience and fostering market steadiness.

As a pioneer of semiconductor technology backed by robust financials and an experienced leadership team, TSM is poised to leverage its novel 3nm technology in a new era of industry standards. Looking ahead, TSM remains bullish in its growth trajectory, with a staggering $100 billion investment in new manufacturing facilities over the next three years. TSM is undervalued by the Street and is a good long-term buy, considering its potential to establish itself as a monopoly for 3nm chips around the world.

**What makes a good business? What makes a good investment?**
A good business first and foremost is creating a valuable good or service, signified by an increasing growth rate (not growth!)

Growth is "+$10 profits a month." Growth rate is "+2x profits a month."

Why growth rate? Because a company growing 1% weekly grows 1.7x yearly. At 5%, it's 12.6x yearly.

This tiny change dictates whether a company dominates a market or struggles afloat. This number also signifies whether the market finds value in the business.

Therefore, a good investment is finding a company that provides value with an increasing growth rate.

Maintaining my 10 year old 200-gallon reef tank sparked my interest in chemistry and engineering: from chemically turning baking soda into sodium carbonate to building an automated dosing system to dose said sodium carbonate to raise alkalinity, I've learned many hands-on skills from keeping my corals as healthy as possible.

But it's more than just hands-on skills. My reef tank is a way for me to protect the marine environment. I aquaculture disease-resistant corals and "frag" them into smaller pieces to sell, which reduces demand for wild corals and thus protect the biodiversity in our oceans.
