# PennSEM Application

**Tell us about a time you took initiative or demonstrated leadership**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, my overworked pharmacist dad had no breaks or days off and was constantly exhausted. To help, I volunteered at the pharmacy to manage simple patient data and handle calls.

As I answered and made hundreds of calls, I discovered that some people couldn't retrieve their medications during lockdown. However, everybody was already working overtime and couldn't help. Hesitantly, I volunteered.

Biking through those eerily quiet, ghost-town-like streets during the pandemic was one of the most profound experiences of my life.

I remember the resilience of families amid uncertainty and fear. From children waving from their windows to elderly individuals who wrote "thank you," each encounter inspired me to keep going, no matter how boring or exhausting delivering medication became. Families battled uncertainty and fear in their homes; elderly patients fought loneliness and despair, and I was there: a frontline worker saving lives.

**Why are you interested in joining Spire? How do you think Spire will help you with your business / idea? Please let us know here if you have any team members applying with you.**
I'm drawn to Spire because it resonates with my entrepreneurial spirit. Having started my own startup (half-exited/half-stopped), I want to understand and learn what makes a startup successful. Which metrics are tracked? What values are prioritized? By joining Spire at PennSEM, I see an opportunity to learn about all of these things.

Since I come from a bioengineering and computer science background, I have the technical skills to make my startup work. However, I think Spire would really help with the marketing side. No startup becomes big without good marketing, even the best ones. I'm sure the 9-week Spire program will teach me a lot about the business side of startups - marketing, branding, budgeting, target audience analysis, sales strategy, etc.

I'm also sure that the people who make up Spire will all have a similar mindset, and there I might potentially find a co-founder! There's probably no better place to meet other startup-focused students at Penn than at Spire.

**What problem are you solving and what is your solution**
Starting my 1st year at Penn, I want to work on HabitDuo - a collaborative habit tracking app. All existing habit tracking apps make habit tracking as an individual journey, and countless studies on the brain tells us that it is not. My goal is to turn habit tracking collaborative - making it more obtainable and fun.

HabitDuo will make sharing habits and keeping your friends accountable a core feature of the app. Similar to Snapchat, users will post updates whenever their habit is achieved.

**What is your core value proposition to consumers? What is your market segment?**
HabitDuo aims to transform the habit-tracking journey from a solo endeavor to a collaborative and engaging experience. Its distinctive feature is leveraging snapchat-like social connectivity to make habit formation more attainable and fun.

The market segment I expect is expansive. It can apply to almost any age group (young students to professionals), as everyone has a habit they want to start. Proof? Everyone makes New Year Resolutions.

More specifically, all students, people wanting to get into gym, personal development, mental health groups, etc.

**How is your solution better than the more competitive alternative?**
