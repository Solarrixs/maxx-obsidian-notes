**Tell us about a time you took initiative or demonstrated leadership**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, my overworked pharmacist dad had no breaks or days off and was constantly exhausted. To help, I volunteered at the pharmacy to manage simple patient data and handle calls.

As I answered and made hundreds of calls, I discovered that some people couldn't retrieve their medications during lockdown. However, everybody was already working overtime and couldn't help. Hesitantly, I volunteered.

Biking through those eerily quiet, ghost-town-like streets during the pandemic was one of the most profound experiences of my life.

I remember the resilience of families amid uncertainty and fear. From children waving from their windows to elderly individuals who wrote "thank you," each encounter inspired me to keep going, no matter how boring or exhausting delivering medication became. Families battled uncertainty and fear in their homes; elderly patients fought loneliness and despair, and I was there: a frontline worker saving lives.
