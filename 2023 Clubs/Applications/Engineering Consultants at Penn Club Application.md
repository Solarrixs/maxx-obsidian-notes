**Tell us about a time you showed leadership**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, my overworked pharmacist dad had no breaks or days off and was constantly exhausted. To help, I volunteered at the pharmacy to manage simple patient data and handle calls.

As I answered and made hundreds of calls, I discovered that some people couldn't retrieve their medications during lockdown. However, everybody was already working overtime and couldn't help. Hesitantly, I volunteered.

Biking through those eerily quiet, ghost-town-like streets during the pandemic was one of the most profound experiences of my life.

I remember the resilience of families amid uncertainty and fear. From children waving from their windows to elderly individuals who wrote "thank you," each encounter inspired me to keep going, no matter how boring or exhausting delivering medication became. Families battled uncertainty and fear in their homes; elderly patients fought loneliness and despair, and I was there: a frontline worker saving lives.

**After years of research and countless nights spent in his lab, Dr. Max had finally created his most prized invention: the insta-plantinator! This device miraculously speeds up a plant's life cycle, allowing crops to grow from seeds to full plants in seconds! While he's proud of his work, he is unsure about how to introduce his product into the United States (and potentially global) market. What factors should Dr. Max consider when bringing his newest creation to market? In addition, please provide strategies you believe he could utilize to maximize his profits.**
