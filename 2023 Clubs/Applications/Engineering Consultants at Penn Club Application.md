**Tell us about a time you showed leadership**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, my overworked pharmacist dad had no breaks or days off and was constantly exhausted. To help, I volunteered at the pharmacy to manage simple patient data and handle calls.

As I answered and made hundreds of calls, I discovered that some people couldn't retrieve their medications during lockdown. However, everybody was already working overtime and couldn't help. Hesitantly, I volunteered.

Biking through those eerily quiet, ghost-town-like streets during the pandemic was one of the most profound experiences of my life.

I remember the resilience of families amid uncertainty and fear. From children waving from their windows to elderly individuals who wrote "thank you," each encounter inspired me to keep going, no matter how boring or exhausting delivering medication became. Families battled uncertainty and fear in their homes; elderly patients fought loneliness and despair, and I was there: a frontline worker saving lives.

**What is something not on your resume but that you feel is essential to your identity?**
Though my resume lists my professional experiences as a market analyst for startups and as a content manager at the largest US EdTech company, these experiences don't highlight my passion for diving deep into diverse fields like astrophotography, self-hosting, or reefing.

Over the past 10 years, my reefing hobby has become deeply meaningful to me. Maintaining my 200-gallon reef tank sparked my interest in chemistry and engineering: from chemically turning baking soda into sodium carbonate to building an automated dosing system to dose said sodium carbonate to raise alkalinity, I've learned many hands-on skills from keeping my corals as healthy as possible.

But it's more than just hands-on skills. My reef tank has become a way for me to help protect the marine environment. I aquaculture disease-resistant corals and "frag" them into smaller pieces to sell, which helps to reduce the demand for wild corals and protect the biodiversity in our oceans.

**What would you want your legacy to be?**
At 8 years old, the dire need for innovation in the Alzheimer's field became starkly apparent to me.

My grandmother, who took care of me while my parents were at work, passed away from Alzheimer's. Her passing not only put immense emotional strain on our family but also propelled me into independence, where I had to bus to school and cook meals for myself until my parents returned home each day.

This led me to conduct Alzheimer's research that spanned 5 years throughout middle and high school, in hopes of advancing progress towards an Alzheimer's cure. Even now, as a first-year student, I'm conducting research at Penn Med.

I envision my legacy to be one where my contributions lead to the eradication of Alzheimer's, saving millions worldwide. I am driven to create a world where no child has to witness the heartbreaking moment of their grandparents forgetting their memories or their grandchildren's names.

**Please describe an upcoming engineering industry and/or product you are excited about.**
One industry I'm excited about is neuromorphic computing, a field that has emerged in just the past 5 years. During my five years of research on neuron functionality and memory processes, I've come to realize that the human brain is an excellent blueprint for constructing powerful and energy-efficient computers. The brain learns extremely quickly and operates hyper-efficiently. For example, competing on Jeopardy requires only your brain to use 20 watts of energy, while IBM Watson needs a staggering 20,000 watts.

Companies developing these chips, such as Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth, and Cortical Labs, can revolutionize our world. Major data servers' electricity costs will plummet by almost 200%, fostering advancements in big data capabilities. Artificial Intelligence, which emulates human neurons (hence, artificial neural networks), could operate on actual neuron circuits, making the technology even more potent. This would be a game-changer in sectors requiring high-complexity simulations, including physics, finance, healthcare, and aerospace.

**After years of research and countless nights spent in his lab, Dr. Max had finally created his most prized invention: the insta-plantinator! This device miraculously speeds up a plant's life cycle, allowing crops to grow from seeds to full plants in seconds! While he's proud of his work, he is unsure about how to introduce his product into the United States (and potentially global) market. What factors should Dr. Max consider when bringing his newest creation to market? In addition, please provide strategies you believe he could utilize to maximize his profits.**
