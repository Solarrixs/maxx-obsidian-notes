**Why do you want to join WITG?**
Investment, stocks

**Pitch a publicly traded company and tell us why you believe it would make a good investment. You may choose to focus on qualitatively evaluating the business model, industry structure, competitive advantages, and potential risks, but otherwise feel free to use the space as you deem fit. Use the same pitch if you apply to two investment teams (you can apply to at most two investment teams). More guidelines can be found on our website at www.pennwitg.com. (500 words)**
