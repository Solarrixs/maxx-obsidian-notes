Everyday, I use fintech services like Stripe for my startup or enjoy the convenience of contactless payments. It's clear how fintech has revolutionized lives worldwide. Joining WUFT would allow me to explore its depth and potential impacts on startups.

With a background as a programmer, startup founder, and stock trader, I have a good blend of finance and tech experience. My journey includes raising $100k (pre-seed round) as a market analyst, running 2 small businesses, and staying updated with Hacker News. I believe this makes me a great fit for the WUFT community.
