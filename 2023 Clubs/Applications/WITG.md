**Why do you want to join WITG?**
Inspired by my dad's daily engagement with stock news, I began stock trading during the pandemic. While I purchased stocks at random, I saw my father drawing lines and reading a company's balance sheet. It looked complicated to me, so I didn't try to learn anything in-depth and just focused on understanding basic fundamentals (P/E ratio, market cap, AGR) and analyzing technical indicators (MACD, RSI, BB bands) with Python. Now that I'm at Penn and more interested in business, I'm hoping WITG will teach me everything I need to understand CNBC on the radio with my dad!

**Pitch a publicly traded company and tell us why you believe it would make a good investment. You may choose to focus on qualitatively evaluating the business model, industry structure, competitive advantages, and potential risks, but otherwise feel free to use the space as you deem fit. Use the same pitch if you apply to two investment teams (you can apply to at most two investment teams). More guidelines can be found on our website at www.pennwitg.com. (500 words)**
