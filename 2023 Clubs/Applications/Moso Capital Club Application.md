# Moso Capital Application

  
Describe yourself in three words.

Driven, Analytical, Entrepreneurial

  

Why are you interested in VC?

I'm drawn to VC because it resonates with my entrepreneurial spirit. Having started my own startup, I want to understand and learn what makes a startup successful. What metrics are tracked? What values are prioritized? By joining the VC space at Moso Capital, I see an opportunity to benefit:

  

1. Myself, by understanding what, why, and how some startups succeed and why 99% fail.

  

2. The Moso Capital team, by contributing my unique insights in biotechnology (having conducted 5 years of biotech-related research) and startup experience, and by bringing my analytical skills and financial literacy.

  

ONE factor to evaluate a startup, what would it be and why?

I'd evaluate a startup's growth rate (not growth!)

  

Growth is "+10 users/month." Growth rate is "2x users/month."

  

Why growth rate? Because a company growing 1% weekly grows 1.7x yearly. At 5%, it's 12.6x yearly.

  

This tiny change dictates whether a company dominates a market or struggles afloat.
