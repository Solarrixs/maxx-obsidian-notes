# Info
Case study standard form:
- Info about case + broad objective
- How would you solve it - diving specifically using math & data
- Summarize

Ask open-ended questions that define the boundaries of the opportunity.
- ex "What results do you want to see from this management training?"

Use active silence.

Confirm your understandings.

- Know your resume. Make sure that you're able to talk about the decisions you made that led you to consulting, and the reasons why. Show how your goals have developed to lead you to the club with which you are interviewing.
- Know why you want to work with the firm. Speak knowledgeably about specific areas of the firm‟s practice in which you are interested. Check recent articles and reports about the company to ask pertinent questions.

Interviewers are trying to determine:
- Do you have analytical skills and logical reasoning to solve problems? Can you break problems down into components and ask relevant questions to achieve a reasonable conclusion?
- Demonstrate composure, maturity, and confidence. Be friendly and communicate with clear and concise language.

Preface questions with a statement describing where you are going with your questioning.
- ex “Now I‟d like to ask some questions about the client‟s distribution channels.”
