“201 Best Questions To Ask On Your Interview” by John Kador

- Problem solving, structured thinking, communicate clearly and concisely

# Info
Case study standard form:
- Info about case + broad objective
- How would you solve it - diving specifically using math & data
- Summarize (be extremely concise here and answer the beginning question)

Ask open-ended questions that define the boundaries of the opportunity.
- ex "What results do you want to see from this management training?"

Use active silence.

Confirm your understandings.

- Know your resume. Make sure that you're able to talk about the decisions you made that led you to consulting, and the reasons why. Show how your goals have developed to lead you to the club with which you are interviewing.
- Know why you want to work with the firm. Speak knowledgeably about specific areas of the firm‟s practice in which you are interested. Check recent articles and reports about the company to ask pertinent questions.

Interviewers are trying to determine:
- Do you have analytical skills and logical reasoning to solve problems? Can you break problems down into components and ask relevant questions to achieve a reasonable conclusion?
- Demonstrate composure, maturity, and confidence. Be friendly and communicate with clear and concise language.

Preface questions with a statement describing where you are going with your questioning.
- ex “Now I‟d like to ask some questions about the client‟s distribution channels.”

If you get stuck, summarize what you have found out up to that point. That helps the interviewer trace your line of thought and buys you time to think about where to go next.

## Case Frameworks
### Income Statements - to analyze changes in profitability
- Component factors: revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses
- **increasing unit price**: demand elasticity, market power, product moat, justification of price premium
- **increasing sales**: increase sales to either current or new customers with existing or new products
- **decrease costs**: what costs are fixed vs variable, the extent and time frame to which costs are avoidable, how costs are allocated
- ex If profits are declining because of a fall in revenues, you may want to focus on marketing issues; if profits are declining because of rising expenses, you may want to look into operations and financing issues.

### Fixed vs. Variable Costs - analyze cost structures of a company to assess scale and scope
- Understand cost structure of a company:
	- ex Capital intensive industries such as manufacturers typically have high fixed costs which makes capacity utilization a crucial part of their business. When fixed costs are high, there are often opportunities for economies of scale or scope.
	- Understand what the important input factors are for a company, and whether these are likely to be fixed or variable
