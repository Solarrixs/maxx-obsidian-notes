The change in total revenue dependent on quantity sold is the marginal revenue.

Marginal revenue can be calculated with: $MR = \dfrac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$

For every linear [[demand curve]]: the slope of the marginal revenue curve will be twice as large (in absolute value) as the slope of the demand curve at the same y-intercept.
- However, the x-intercept of the marginal revenue is in the middle of a demand curve (at the unit elastic point).

Therefore,
- MR = 0 for [[unit elastic demand]] ([[elastic demand]] = 1)
- MR > 0 for [[elastic demand]] (ED > 1), meaning total revenue increases
- MR < 0 for [[inelastic demand]] (ED < 1), meaning total revenue decreases
