# Price Controls
## Price Ceilings
Upper limit on price of a good. This has no effect unless it becomes a binding price ceiling (when a price ceiling prevents the equilibrium quantity/price to go above the limit).

A binding price ceiling will cause shortage of goods only if the maximum price is below the equilibrium price.
- star Quantity demanded > quantity supplied

Price ceilings causes sellers to have more "bargaining power" (imagine 10 buyers for 1 seller, the seller can choose who to sell to). This may mean illegal activities (black markets) and that the total price of a good may be above the regulated price ceiling.

Price ceiling also lead to underproduction, leading to [[deadweight loss]].

![[price ceiling deadweight loss.png|400]]
- A+B+C = [[consumer surplus]]
- D+E+F = [[producer surplus]]

![[price ceilings deadweight loss.png|400]]
- F = producer surplus
- A+B+D = consumer surplus
- C+E = deadweight loss (because of excess demand)

Total revenue of sellers decreases if the equilibrium point is in the [[elastic demand]] curve portion. 

## Price Floors
Lower limit on price of a good. Generally same concepts as above but opposite.
- Price floors aim to increases prices and decreases quantity sold
- Causes surplus in quantity supplied - leading to illegal black markets or unemployment

![[price floor deadweight loss.png|450]]
- Consumer surplus decreases to A
- Producer surplus increases to B+D+F
- Deadweight loss is C+E (because of excess demand)

- star A price ceiling is below the equilibrium price and a price floor is above the equilibrium price!
- star Price controls do not ALWAYS generate a [[deadweight loss]] - if it's not binding or if supply or demand was perfectly inelastic.

## Equity and Fairness
Price controls lead to a tradeoff between efficiency and fairness.

# Taxes and Subsidies
Taxes reduce quantity demanded and quantity supplied of the taxed goods since buyers pay more and sellers receive less.

## Tax on Sellers
You pay the regular price of a good, but the seller keeps what you pay minus the tax.

The tax is a [[marginal cost]] to sellers because it is an additional cost they must pay for each unit they sell. Since [[supply]] curve is the same as the [[marginal cost]] curve, when $MC$ increases, the supply curve shifts in (decrease).

- star The magnitude of supply curve shift is the amount of tax per unit imposed on sellers. This can be determined on a supply-demand curve.

![[tax on sellers.png|600]]

When goods are taxed, you must distinguish between price paid by buyers $P_{B}$ and price received by sellers $P_{S}$. So a demand equation and supply equation looks like:
$$
Q_{D} = 2.50 - P_{B}
$$
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{S} - 0.8
$$
Assuming the seller pays $0.30 in taxes, then you can relate $P_{B}$ and $P_{S}$ like this:
$$
P_{S} = P_{B} - 0.30
$$
Then you can rewrite the supply equation to the new "taxed' supply curve equation:
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{B} - 1.4
$$
On a graph, that means the vertical change from one price to another price is the taxed amount, while the diagonal change from one equilibrium to the second equilibrium is the tax buyers pay per unit. The vertical change from the second equilibrium to the when it intersects the original supply curve is the price sellers pay.

## Tax on Buyers
The [[demand curve]] = [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] curve. Since there is a tax on buyers, there is less marginal benefit per unit, so the demand curve will shift down by the amount of tax.
![[tax on buyers.png|600]]

Following the same steps as in on the Tax on Sellers, you set the equation $P_{B} = P_{S} + \$\text{tax}$, then replace $P_{B}$ with $P_{S}$ in the $Q_{D}$ equation. Then, since $Q_{D} = Q_{S}$, solve the equation.

## Economic Tax Incidence
Whether a tax is levied on buyers or sellers, it has the same economic effect. The tax burden affects both buyers and sellers. 

Thus, whoever can avoid the tax (not buying or selling the taxed good) will benefit more. This depends on the [[price elasticity of supply]] and [[price elasticity of demand]] since taxes change the demand and supply curve.

- star The side of the market that is more elastic will have a smaller share of the tax burden. If the distance from New Price to Original Price is greater than the distance from the Original Price to the Price to Producer, then buyers will pay more of the tax.

If there is perfectly inelastic demand or supply, then either the buyers or sellers will pay for the entire tax.

## Welfare Effects of Taxes
Taxes reduce [[consumer surplus]] and [[producer surplus]] but increases government revenue. Thus, total surplus can be determined.
![[welfare effects of taxes.png]]
- Tax decreases consumer surplus by A+B
- Tax decreases producer surplus by C+D
- Government tax revenue increases by A+C
- [[deadweight loss]] by taxes is B+D or (decrease in quantity) $\times$ (tax difference)

The more elastic the demand or supply curve is, the larger reduction in quantity sold due to tax, and lower the tax revenue for the government. So it is better to impose a tax on inelastic demands and supplies.

To minimize deadweight loss, tax should be imposed on inelastic demand and supply.

## Subsidies
Subsidies encourage the consumption or production of certain goods. Applying the principles above, a subsidy is just a negative tax.

This means demand curve increases or supply curve increases.
![[subsidies.png]]

Suppliers get more money and buyers spend less money, but the government loses money.

This causes overproduction, so consumer and producer surplus increase. Government expenditure will be larger than the increase in consumer and producer surplus.
![[welfare effects of subsidies.png|500]]
- E is the deadweight loss

- star The side of the market that is more elastic captures less of a subsidy. The same principle for perfectly inelasticity from taxes applies similarly.
