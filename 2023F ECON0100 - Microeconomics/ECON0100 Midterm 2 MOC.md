# Taxes and Subsidies
Taxes reduce quantity demanded and quantity supplied of the taxed goods since buyers pay more and sellers receive less.

## Tax on Sellers
You pay the regular price of a good, but the seller keeps what you pay minus the tax.

The tax is a [[marginal cost]] to sellers because it is an additional cost they must pay for each unit they sell. Since [[supply]] curve is the same as the [[marginal cost]] curve, when $MC$ increases, the supply curve shifts in (decrease).

- star The magnitude of supply curve shift is the amount of tax per unit imposed on sellers. This can be determined on a supply-demand curve.

When goods are taxed, you must distinguish between price paid by buyers $P_{B}$ and price received by sellers $P_{S}$. So a demand equation and supply equation looks like:
$$
Q_{D} = 2.50 - P_{B}
$$
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{S} - 0.8
$$
Assuming the seller pays $0.30 in taxes, then you can relate $P_{B}$ and $P_{S}$ like this:
$$
P_{S} = P_{B} - 0.30
$$
Then you can rewrite the supply equation to the new "taxed' supply curve equation:
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{B} - 1.4
$$
On a graph, that means the vertical change from one price to another price is the taxed amount, while the diagonal change from one equilibrium to the second equilibrium is the tax buyers pay per unit. The vertical change from the second equilibrium to the when it intersects the original supply curve is the price sellers pay.

## Tax on Buyers
The [[demand curve]] = [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] curve. Since there is a tax on buyers, there is less marginal benefit per unit, so the demand curve will shift down by the amount of tax.

Following the same steps as in on the Tax on Sellers, you set the equation $P_{B} = P_{S} + \$\text{tax}$, then replace $P_{B}$ with $P_{S}$ in the $Q_{D}$ equation. Then, since $Q_{D} = Q_{S}$, solve the equation.

## Economic Tax Incidence
Whether a tax is levied on buyers or sellers, it has the same economic effect. The tax burden affects both buyers and sellers.
