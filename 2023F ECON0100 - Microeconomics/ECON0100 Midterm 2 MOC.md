# Price Controls

Assumed in [[competitive equilibrium]] situations (perfect competition).

## Price Ceilings
Upper limit on price of a good. This has no effect unless it becomes a binding (effective) price ceiling (when a price ceiling prevents the equilibrium quantity/price to go above the limit).

A binding (or effective) price ceiling will cause **shortage** of goods only if the maximum price is below the equilibrium price.
- star Quantity demanded > quantity supplied
- & Otherwise it is not binding or not effective because it doesn't affect equilibrium price or quantity.

Price ceilings causes sellers to have more "bargaining power" (imagine 10 buyers for 1 seller, the seller can choose who to sell to). This may mean illegal activities (black markets) and that the total price of a good may be above the regulated price ceiling.

Price ceiling also lead to underproduction, leading to [[deadweight loss]].

![[price ceiling deadweight loss.png|400]]
- A+B+C = [[consumer surplus]]
- D+E+F = [[producer surplus]]
- & This is prior to price ceilings.

![[price ceilings deadweight loss.png|400]]
- F = producer surplus
- A+B+D = consumer surplus
- C+E = [[deadweight loss]] (because of excess demand)
- & This is after price ceilings.

Total revenue of sellers decreases if the equilibrium point is in the [[elastic demand]] curve portion.
![[price controls and elasticity.png]]
- More inelastic = less deadweight loss and less shortage.
- star Over time, people and businesses become more elastic, meaning that shortage and deadweight loss increase over time if a price ceiling is in effect.

## Price Floors
Lower limit on price of a good. Generally same concepts as above but opposite.
- Price floors aim to increases prices and decreases quantity sold
- Causes **surplus** in quantity supplied - leading to illegal black markets or unemployment

![[price floor deadweight loss.png|450]]
- Consumer surplus decreases to A
- Producer surplus increases to B+D+F
- [[deadweight loss]] is C+E (because of excess demand)
- & This is after price floors.

- star A price ceiling is below the equilibrium price and a price floor is above the equilibrium price!
- star Price controls do not ALWAYS generate a [[deadweight loss]] - if it's not binding or if supply or demand was perfectly inelastic.

- ex A good example of price floor is minimum wage, where workers are the supply. Demand and supply of different jobs are different so equilibrium price is different even with a price floor.

## Equity and Fairness
Price controls lead to a tradeoff between efficiency and fairness.

Sometimes the government aims to slice the pie in favor of one group (either [[producer surplus]] or [[consumer surplus]]) over another even if the entire pie shrinks (efficiency decreases).

### Price Controls in Imperfect Competition
In a monopolistic competition, where the firms have market power, the firms will sell where [[marginal revenue]] intersects [[marginal cost]] shifted up towards the [[demand curve|marginal benefit]]. However, by setting a price control, firms are forced to sell at a certain price, thus turning it into a perfectly competitive market type (you can ignore MR).

- star In this case, price controls can actually *improve* efficiency in imperfect competition.

# Taxes and Subsidies
Taxes reduce quantity demanded and quantity supplied of the taxed goods since buyers pay more and sellers receive less. This can be done on purpose (sin taxes) by the government to reduce the quantity supplied of certain goods like harmful cigarettes.

Governments use taxation to raise revenue (finance spending or redistribution).

Excise taxes is a fixed amount of tax for each unit sold per unit.

## Tax on Sellers
You pay the regular price of a good, but the seller keeps what you pay minus the tax.

The tax is a [[marginal cost]] to sellers because it is an additional cost they must pay for each unit they sell. Since [[supply]] curve is the same as the [[marginal cost]] curve, when $MC$ increases, the supply curve shifts in (decrease).

- star The magnitude of supply curve shift is the amount of tax per unit imposed on sellers. This can be determined on a supply-demand curve.

![[tax on sellers.png|600]]

When goods are taxed, you must distinguish between price paid by buyers $P_{B}$ and price received by sellers $P_{S}$. So a demand equation and supply equation looks like:
$$
Q_{D} = 2.50 - P_{B}
$$
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{S} - 0.8
$$
Assuming the seller pays \$0.30 in taxes, then you can relate $P_{B}$ and $P_{S}$ like this:
$$
P_{S} = P_{B} - 0.30
$$
Then you can rewrite the supply equation to the new "taxed' supply curve equation:
$$
Q_{S} = 2P_{B} - 1.4
$$
On a graph, that means the vertical change from one price to another price is the taxed amount, while the diagonal change from one equilibrium to the second equilibrium is the tax buyers pay per unit. The vertical change from the second equilibrium to the when it intersects the original supply curve is the price sellers pay.

- star $P_{B} - P_{S} = \text{tax amount}$. This equation can be used to calculate $Q_{tax}$ by plugging in these values.

## Tax on Buyers
The [[demand curve]] = [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] curve. Since there is a tax on buyers, there is less marginal benefit per unit, so the demand curve will shift down by the amount of tax.

![[tax on buyers.png|600]]

Following the same steps as in on the Tax on Sellers, you set the equation $P_{B} = P_{S} + \$\text{tax}$, then replace $P_{B}$ with $P_{S}$ in the $Q_{D}$ equation. Then, since $Q_{D} = Q_{S}$, solve the equation.

## Economic Tax Incidence
Whether a tax is levied on buyers or sellers, it has the same economic effect. The tax burden affects both buyers and sellers. 

Thus, whoever can avoid the tax (not buying or selling the taxed good) will benefit more. This depends on the [[price elasticity of supply]] and [[price elasticity of demand]] since taxes change the demand and supply curve.

![[tax incidence based on elasticity.png]]
- The blue rectangle: total tax paid by buyers
- The red rectangle: total tax paid by sellers
- Blue + Red = tax revenue for government

- star More inelastic = larger tax burden. If the distance from New Price to Original Price is greater than the distance from the Original Price to the Price to Producer, then buyers will pay more of the tax.

If there is perfectly inelastic demand or supply, then either the buyers or sellers will pay for the entire tax and either buyers or sellers will pay $0 in tax (price remains the same). DWL is 0 in perfectly inelastic demand or supply.

![[perfectly inelastic demand and supply on tax.png|600]]

## Welfare Effects of Taxes
Taxes reduce [[consumer surplus]] and [[producer surplus]] but increases government revenue. Thus, total surplus can be determined.

![[welfare effects of taxes.png]]
- Tax decreases consumer surplus by A+B
- Tax decreases producer surplus by C+D
- Government tax revenue increases by A+C
- [[deadweight loss]] by taxes is B+D or (decrease in quantity) $\times$ (tax difference)
- Total surplus is the space above A (CS) + the space below C (PS) + the tax revenue (A+C)

The more elastic the demand or supply curve is, the larger reduction in quantity sold due to tax, and lower the tax revenue for the government. So it is better to impose a tax on inelastic demands and supplies.

To minimize deadweight loss and maximize revenue, tax should be imposed on inelastic demand and supply.

## Subsidies
Subsidies encourage the consumption or production of certain goods. Applying the principles above, a subsidy is just a negative tax.

- star $P_{S} - P_{B} = $\text{subsidy}$

This means demand curve increases or supply curve increases.
![[subsidies.png]]

Suppliers get more money and buyers spend less money (CS and PS increases), but the government loses money.

This causes overproduction, so consumer and producer surplus increase. Government expenditure will be larger than the increase in consumer and producer surplus, causing deadweight loss.
![[welfare effects of subsidies.png|500]]
- Government loss is ABCDE.

- star The side of the market that is more inelastic captures more of a subsidy (positive). The same principle for perfectly inelasticity from taxes applies similarly.

# Trade

## Production Possibilities Curve
Under the curve is inefficient but attainable.
On the curve is efficient and attainable.
Over the curve is unattainable unless new technology or new resources are available.

You can calculate [[opportunity cost]] from this:
- $\text{Opportunity Cost of a Task} = \dfrac{\text{hours this task takes}}{\text{hours required to produce alternative output}}$
- That is the **absolute value of the slope of the PPC curve** of good X in terms of good Y
- The inverse of the slope is the opportunity cost of good Y in terms of good X

### Specialization
People focus on the production of certain goods and services to make more efficient use of its resources, then trade those for other goods. Specialization = more production = expand production possibilities.

Someone who can produce more than another person has absolute advantage.
- star An individual can produce a good using fewer resources than another individual.

However, to get the most outputs, each person should do the task with the lowest opportunity cost, which is their comparative advantage.
- Each person can only have 1 comparative advantage over another.
- star An individual can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another individual.

### Terms of Trade
People who trade with each other have terms of trade range. Assuming each person is self-sufficient in production, the trading price must lie between the opportunity costs of both people.

## Trade Line (Consumption Possibility Curve)
Shows the combinations each person can consume after specialization and trade.

The slope reflects the terms at which people trade Good Y for Good X.

Trade lines are above each person's individual PPC. Specialization and trade allow people to reach a consumption point above the attainable PPC.

## Joint PPC
In this example, two states combine their PPC capabilities to trade internationally. At first, the state with the lower opportunity cost will make automobiles instead of computer chips, up until point T when it completely specializes in automobiles.

The kink in the joint PPC is the Y and X intercept of the higher producer.

![[joint PPC.png|600]]

The slope of a joint PPC is the price of Good X in terms of Good Y.

The position of the joint PPC lies beyond the joint PPC. There exists 3 cases:
- The world price of Good X has a lower opportunity cost (slope): then the new trade line has a flatter slope and starts at the Y intercept.
- The world price of Good X has a higher opportunity cost (slope): then the new trade line has a steeper slope and starts at the X intercept.
- The world price of Good X is in between the lower and higher opportunity cost (slope): then it has a medium slope and starts at the kink. It exports and imports depending on the position of the consumption point.

## Economy Wide PPC
An economy with millions of resources and workers will have a joint PPC with many kinks, which can be simplified to a concave bowed out curved line.

![[economy wide PPC.png|550]]
- Note that this shows the increasing [[opportunity cost]] principle.

Improvement in overall productivity shifts the entire PPC outwards.
Improvement in a specific productivity or new resource for an industry pivots the PPC.

When trading with the rest of the world:
- The slope is the world opportunity cost of Good X
- The position such that the PPC touches the trade line is the point of production.

## Supply, Demand, and PPC
A country that does not trade is in autarky.
If that country opens its borders to free trade, it will either import or export automobiles depending on how the autarky price compares to the world price:
- If world price > autarky price, domestic producers will increase their quantity supplied to benefit from the higher price, while domestic consumers will decrease their demand. This surplus causes the domestic producers to export automobiles.
- If world price < autarky price, domestic producers will increase their quantity demanded to benefit from the lower price, while domestic producers will decrease their supply. This shortage causes domestic consumers to import automobiles.

- star If the autarky price is low, the cost of producing domestically is low, so the country has a comparative advantage.

### Gains and Losses from Imports
![[gains and losses from imports.png]]
- Autarky [[consumer surplus]] = A
- Autarky [[producer surplus]] = B+C
- star After opening to trade, domestic price will become equal to the world price
- Domestic producers will sell a lower quantity at a lower price, so PS = C 
- Domestic consumers buy a larger quantity at a lower price, so CS = A+B+D
- Total surplus increases by D

### Gains and Losses from Exports
![[gains and losses from exports.png]]
- Autarky [[consumer surplus]] = A+B
- Autarky [[producer surplus]] = C
- star After opening to trade, domestic price will become equal to the world price
- Domestic producers will sell a higher quantity at a higher price, so PS = B+C+D 
- Domestic consumers buy a smaller quantity at a larger price, so CS = A
- Total surplus increases by D

## Politics of International Trade
Import-competing businesses oppose international trade.
Exporters and import-dependent businesses support international trade.

- National security requires that we produce strategically important goods ourselves
- Protection can help infant industries develop
- Anti-dumping laws prevent unfair competition
- Trade shouldn't be a way to skirt regulations
- Foreign competition may lead to job losses

## Protectionist Trade Policies
Tariffs are taxes on an imported good. This raises revenue for governments and serves the interest of domestic producers.

![[tariffs.png]]
- star Tariffs helps domestic producers but hurts domestic consumers and foreign producers
