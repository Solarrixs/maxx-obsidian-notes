If the price of good A falls, then one has more purchasing power for good A and will obtain a higher level of [[marginal utility]] as one can buy more of good A (if it is a normal good and not an inferior good).
- Increasing purchasing power means a change in real income, so the [[budget line]] shifts outwards, which can be calculated if you know the price of both goods

The direction of the income effect depends on whether the good is normal or inferior:
- Normal good (people buy more of that good): income effect reinforces the [[substitution effects]]
- Inferior good (people buy less of that good): income effect counters the [[substitution effects]]
- star If both goods are complement normal goods, then consumption of both goods increases
