If the price of good A falls, then one has more purchasing power for good A and will obtain a higher level of utility as one can buy more of good A (if it is a normal good and not an inferior good).

The direction of the income effect depends on whether the good is normal or inferior:
- Normal good: income effect reinforces the [[substitution effects]]
- Inferior good: income effect counters the [[substitution effects]]
