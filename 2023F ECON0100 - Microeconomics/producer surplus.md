$PS = TR - VC$
- Total revenue - variable costs
- Price - [[marginal cost]]

It is similar to [[profit]]: $PS = \pi + FC$.
- The quantity that maximizes profit also maximizes producer surplus

Compared to a [[consumer surplus]]:
- The consumer's total expenditure is the producer's total revenue
- The area above the marginal cost line but below the demand is the total benefit
