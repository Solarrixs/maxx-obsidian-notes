$\dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta \text{Income}}$

The income elasticity of demand measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to income change.

$E^D_{I}>0$ for normal goods (goods you buy more of when your income goes up).
- Luxury goods: $1<E^D_{I}$
- Necessities: $0<E^D_{I}<1$

$E^D_{I}<0$ for inferior goods.
