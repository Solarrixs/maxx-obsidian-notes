$(E_{D})$ = $\dfrac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}} = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta P}$.
- This should be a negative number due to the law of demand but **absolute value** is taken to see the magnitude of change.

$E_{D}$ measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes.
- If $E_{D} > 1$: [[elastic demand]] as quantity is responsive.
- If $E_{D} < 1$: [[inelastic demand]] as quantity is not responsive.
- If $E_{D} = 1$: [[unit elastic demand]].
- If $E_{D} = \infty$: perfectly elastic demand.
- If $E_{D} = 0$: perfectly inelastic demand.

## Midpoint (Arc Elasticity)
To calculate $E_{D}$, you need to take the percent change by taking the price or quantity change divided by the average value of price or quantity times 100.

$\Delta\% = \dfrac{\text{final - initial}}{average}$

- ex If 9 pizzas are bought at $20.50 and 11 pizzas are bought at $19.50, then $-\frac{1}{20} \times 100 = -5\%$ is the percentage change in price
- ex $\frac{2}{10} \times 100 = 20\%$ is the percentage change in quantity demanded
- ex $E_{D} = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{20\%}{-5\%} = -4$

## Determinants
1. Availability of substitutes. More substitutes makes it easier to switch consumption of goods in response to a price increase, so there is a greater elasticity.
2. If the amount spent on a good makes a large % of one's income, the person will be more sensitive to a change in price and so there is greater elasticity.
3. The longer we have to adjust to a price change, the more elastic demand will be.
