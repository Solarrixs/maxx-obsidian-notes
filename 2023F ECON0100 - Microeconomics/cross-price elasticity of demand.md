$\dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}\text{ of }A}{\%\Delta B_{\text{price}}}$

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another.
- The goods are usually different products that may be related

**If positive, then the two goods are substitutes.**
- You buy more of a good when the price of another good goes up.
- A small cross-price elasticity means the goods aren't close substitutes

**If negative, then the two goods are complements.**
- You buy less of a good when the price of another good goes up

**Equals 0 for non-related goods**.
