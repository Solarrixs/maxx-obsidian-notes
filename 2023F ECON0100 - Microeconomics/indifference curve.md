An indifference curve shows two combinations of goods that provide an equal level of satisfaction ([[consumer utility]]). An indifference curve lying on the right and above another curve reflects higher utility levels.
- ! Intersecting indifference curves are impossible because the same bundle cannot provide 2 different levels of utility to an individual 

Indifference curves has a negative slope because taking away [[marginal utility]] is a "negative" thing. It is also a convex shape (flatter curve as we move down and to the right) because marginal utility decreases as quantity consumed increases (the ratio of [[marginal rate of substitution]] decreases).
- An undesirable good leads to a positive indifference curve

The movement along an indifferent curve can be calculated with the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

When two goods are perfect substitutes, the indifference curve is a straight line. When two goods are perfect complements, the indifference curve is an L shape.
