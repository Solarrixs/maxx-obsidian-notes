The 3 average costs of production:
- Average fixed cost (AFC): total fixed cost per unit of output
- Average variable cost (AVC): total variable cost per unit of output
- Average total cost (ATC): total cost per unit of output

Because $TC = VC + FC$, dividing each term by quantity becomes $ATC = AVC + AFC$.

![[ATC, AVC, AFC curve.png|450]]

ATC and AVC curves are U-shaped because the size of fixed cost compared to the size of variable cost is large at low outputs but small at high outputs (because of diminishing returns on variable costs).

When [[marginal cost]] is below average costs, average costs are downward sloping.
When [[marginal cost]] exceeds average costs, average costs are upward sloping.
When [[marginal cost]] and average costs are equal, average costs is at minimum.
