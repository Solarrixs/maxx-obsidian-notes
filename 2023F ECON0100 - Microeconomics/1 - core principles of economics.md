In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the [[scarcity principle]] and its results. People can make choices based on the [[cost-benefit principle]], avoiding [[sunk costs]], and applying the [[marginal principle]] with the overall goal of obtaining an [[economic surplus]].

The [[scarcity principle]] causes each decision to have an [[opportunity cost]].

Thus, people must make choices to best use the [[scarce resources]] available.

As a whole, society relies on the [[interdependence principle]] to make decisions beneficial for all of society.

# Economic Models
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions

# Consumer Choice
To analyze customer behavior, we can assume that everyone is trying to maximize their personal measure of satisfaction gained from the consumption of goods and services. This is called consumer's utility.

The positive change in utility is called marginal utility - the more the better. However, there is diminishing returns in the marginal utility the more you get. This is called diminishing marginal utility.

An indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. To simplify, assume that there are only two goods a consumer can choose between. It's similar to a PPC curve.
- It has a negative slope because taking away marginal utility is a negative thing
- It is convex because marginal utility decreases as quantity consumed increases. So the more you have something, the less you value each additional thing. This is called the marginal rate of substitution. $MRS_{xy} = \frac{\Delta Q_{y}}{\Delta Q_{x}}$, read as MRS of X for Y.
- Since everyone has a different preference and utility value, indifference curves have the same general shape but aren't exactly the same
