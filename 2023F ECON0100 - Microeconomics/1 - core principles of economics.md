In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the [[scarcity principle]] and its results. People can make choices based on the [[cost-benefit principle]], avoiding [[sunk costs]], and applying the [[marginal principle]].

The [[scarcity principle]] causes each decision to have an [[opportunity cost]].

Thus, people must make choices to best use the [[scarce resources]] available. Scarcity in economics isn't a shortage of a resource. It's that a resource is scarce if something has to be given up to achieve something else, like time or money.

As a whole, society relies on the [[interdependence principle]] to make decisions beneficial for all of society.

# Economic Models
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions'

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions
