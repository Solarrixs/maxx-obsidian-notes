In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the [[scarcity principle]] and its results. People can make choices based on the [[cost-benefit principle]], avoiding [[sunk costs]], and applying the [[marginal principle]] with the overall goal of obtaining an [[economic surplus]].

The [[scarcity principle]] causes each decision to have an [[opportunity cost]].

Thus, people must make choices to best use the [[scarce resources]] available.

As a whole, society relies on the [[interdependence principle]] to make decisions beneficial for all of society.

# Economic Models
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions

# Consumer Choice
To analyze customer behavior, we can assume that everyone is trying to maximize their personal measure of satisfaction gained from the consumption of goods and services. This is called consumer's utility.

The positive change in utility is called marginal utility - the more the better. However, there is diminishing returns in the marginal utility the more you get. This is called diminishing marginal utility.

An indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. To simplify, assume that there are only two goods a consumer can choose between. It's similar to a PPC curve.
- It has a negative slope because taking away marginal utility is a negative thing
- It is convex (flatter curve as we move down and to the right) because marginal utility decreases as quantity consumed increases. So the more you have something, the less you value each additional thing. This is called the marginal rate of substitution. $MRS_{xy} = \frac{\Delta Q_{y}}{\Delta Q_{x}}$, read as MRS of X for Y.
- Since everyone has a different preference and utility value, indifference curves have the same general shape but aren't exactly the same
- An indifference curve lying on the right and above another curve reflects higher utility levels
- Intersecting indifference curves are impossible because the same bundle cannot provide 2 different levels of utility to an individual

Marginal utility can be written as $MU_{x}$ and $MU_{y}$ for a bundle and the quantity of an item in a bundle is written as $\Delta Q_{x}$ and $\Delta Q_{y}$. Thus, $-MU_{x} \times \Delta Q_{x} = MU_{y}\times\Delta Q_{y}$ in an indifference curve.

Thus, $MRS_{xy} = \frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}$
- As we move down the curve, X is decreasing while Y is increasing, meaning that the ratio of $MU_{x}:MU_{y}$ is decreasing and thus it is a diminishing marginal utility and a convex curve.

There can be perfect substitutes of marginal utility - there is a constant slope and not a convex slope.

There can be perfect complements of marginal utility - the utility of one good depends on it being used with another good. These are L shaped. Consumer's utility only rises when they have more of both goods in  the same proportion. The $MRS_{xy}$ becomes either infinity, 0, or undefined.

A bad good leads to a positive indifference curve.

Anything within the slope is feasible and obtainable. The line is called the budget line, and shows all consumption bundles available.
- Budget lines can shift up and down depending on price of goods or change in income

Combine the budget line and the indifference curve to find out the optimal consumption choice. The optimal bundle is under the budget line but on the highest indifference curve. The indifference curve should be tangent to the budget line.
- $MRS_{xy} = \frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \frac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}$
- The ratio of price of goods someone buys should equal the marginal rate of substitution
- Price cannot change, so change the MRS so the equation becomes true. Remember, decreasing $MU$ means buying more of it.

When two goods are perfect substitutes, the consumer will consume the good with a lower price.

When two goods are perfect complements, they are consumed in the same rate in relation with each other.

# Consumer Choice 2
An individual's demand curve can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good. You will get data for price to quantity demanded, which can be plotted.
- Quantity demanded is higher when price is lower
