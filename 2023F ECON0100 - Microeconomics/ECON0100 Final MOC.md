# Externalities
Externality is the side effect on bystanders whose interests are not taken into account. This leads to failure, producing inefficient outcomes.

Externalities cause conflicts between **private interest (costs and benefits we occur)** and **society's interest (costs and benefits of other people)**.

Even though in perfectly competitive markets, it is efficient (MB = MC), we don't take into account externalities. Therefore, we want to find the socially efficient outcome (outcome efficient for all of society's costs and benefits). Therefore:
- star Socially efficient outcome occurs when social [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] = social [[marginal cost]]

![[externalities chart.png]]

## Negative externality
### Producers
- ex Exhaust from your car harms others who breathe in your pollution

There are private [[marginal cost]] and external [[marginal cost]]. Sellers account for private MC but not external MC, which is the harm that negative externalities (pollution) impose on bystanders.

The firm's private cost and external cost = marginal social cost
- star MSC = private MC + external MC

![[negative externalities.png]]
- MSC is above the supply curve ([[marginal cost]]) with a difference equal to the external MC

### Consumers
- ex Smoking cigarettes

- star Marginal social benefit (MSB) = private [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] - external [[marginal cost]] (MSB = MB - MEC)

![[negative externalities by consumers.png]]

### Consequences
Negative externalities lead to overproduction.

![[consequence of negative production externality.png]]
- Since efficient quantity < quantity market, there is overproduction

![[welfare effects of negative esternalities.png]]
- MSC = MPC + MEC
- MSB = MPB ([[demand curve]])

At private market efficiency (Q1):
- Total private surplus = [[producer surplus]] + [[consumer surplus]] = A + B + E
- Total external cost = area between MPC and MSC = B + E + D
- Total social surplus = total private surplus - total external cost = A - D
- D is the [[deadweight loss]] as a result of private markets not accounting for social costs

At social market efficiency (Q2):
- Total private surplus = [[producer surplus]] + [[consumer surplus]] = A + B
- Total external cost = area between MPC and MSC = B
- Total social surplus = total private surplus - total external cost = A

Private total surplus = area between MPC and MSB (demand)
Social total surplus = area between MSC and MSB (demand)

A market doesn't produce at socially efficient quantity with external costs because the MSC exceeds the MSB at market quantity.

MSC is greater than MPC at any output level.

## Positive externality
### Consumers
- ex Getting a COVID19 shots makes you and other people less likely to get sick

- Social [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] = MB + external MB

![[positive externalities.png]]
- The external MB is included in social MB, which is why the social MB is above the [[demand curve]], and the wedge between them reflects the external MB

### Producers
- Social [[marginal cost]] = MC - external MB

![[positive externalities by producers.png]]

### Consequences
Positive externalities lead to underproduction.

MSB = MPB + MEB

![[consequences of positive externalities.png]]
- Since efficient quantity > quantity market, there is underproduction

![[welfare effects of positive externalities.png]]
- Total private surplus = between MPB and MPC at Q1 = b
- Total external surplus = between MSB and MSC at Q1 = a
- Total social surplus = private + external surplus = a + b
- At Q2, the total private surplus = b - f
- At Q2, the external surplus = a + d + f
- At Q2, the total social surplus = a + b + d
- [[deadweight loss]] = d

Therefore, the market does not produce an efficient amount because at the market quantity, the MPC = MPB but is less than the MSB.

# Correcting Externalities
Negative externalities lead to overproduction (higher quantity than efficient quantity)
Positive externalities lead to underproduction (lower quantity than efficient quantity)

## Private Bargaining (Coase Theorem)
Coase theorem - economy can always reach an efficient solution if costs of making a deal is low enough for private bargaining
- ex Someone pays another person to compensate for their negative/positive externalities

- star If MSB > MSC, then increase the quantity to find the efficient quantity

If you have property right, you can prevent someone else from doing an action that you don't like. However, no matter the property right, negotiation through private bargaining with side payments can happen to fix market failures from externalities.
- star This solution only works if the externality affects few people a lot, and not effective on many people a little bit (like global warming). The government should step in in the second example.

Alternatively, someone can pay you money so you allow them to do an action to reach efficient quantity.
- star The money you pay should be between your [[marginal cost]] and their [[demand curve|marginal benefit]]

## Taxes and Subsidies
Government can use quantity through taxes and subsidies to correct the market price.

Negative externality - pigovian tax
- star The efficient tax is the distance between the original MPC and new MSC at the efficient quantity. This is also the MEC at the efficient quantity.

Positive externality - pigovian subsidy
- star The efficient subsidy is the distance between the original MPB and new MSB at the efficient quantity. This is also the MEB at the efficient quantity.

## Cap and Trade & Regulation
Governments impose a quota on the efficient quantity so producers are forced to produce at a certain quota through permits. Companies can pay for more permits from other companies.

Regulate on quantity like banning smoking, fuel efficiency standards, etc

# Monopolies
![[types of market structures.png]]

A monopoly is 1 firm that has no competition:
- No competitor entries - profit in long run is positive
- Firm demand is the market demand due to high market power and pricing power, so P > [[marginal cost]], leading to maximum [[profit]] and [[producer surplus]]
- Thus, monopolies underproduces compared to the efficient quantity, leading to decreased [[total surplus]] and creating a [[deadweight loss]].
- star For a monopoly, the quantity produced is MR = MPC

Monopolies has no supply curve, it has a [[marginal cost]] of the firm/market
- Max profit quantity is when [[marginal revenue]] = [[marginal cost]] (MR=MC)
- Max profit price is the [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] above the demand curve
- Profit = $Q(P-ATC)$
- star Monopolies always produces in the elastic portion of demand ($E_{D} > 1$)

Since monopolies lead to underproduction, you can remove negative externalities (which has overproduction) by creating monopolies compared to perfect competition.

If the negative externality is really strong, then a monopoly + tax will work in achieving the efficient quantity.
- MPC + tax = MR at $Q_{E}$

If the negative externality is really weak, then a monopoly + subsidy will work in achieving the efficient quantity.
- MPC - subsidy = MR at $Q_{E}$

If the market has a positive externality, you do not want a monopoly and would rather have perfect competition market. Since monopolies generate underproduction.

# Price Discrimination
Firm can charge different prices if:
- The firm has market power (non-competitive market)
- Firms can identify and separate types of buyers based on their demand
- Firm can prevent arbitrage

1st degree PD - every consumer is charged the maximum price they are willing to pay
2nd degree PD - higher unit purchased results in lower prices per unit
3rd degree PD - different prices based on price elasticity of different consumers

1st degree price discrimination is perfect (perfect price discrimination).
- Rare because you need a ton of data on each buyer such that you charge each buyer the perfect amount they were going to pay
- A monopoly firm sells such that MR = MC (meaning that the [[marginal revenue]] is just the [[demand curve]])

![[perfect price discrimination monopoly.png]]
- For PPD, there is no one price a consumer pays.
- For PPD, [[consumer surplus]] is 0 and the [[total surplus]] is maximum (no [[deadweight loss]]).

# Natural Monopolies
If an industry has a natural monopoly, a single firm can produce at a lower per unit cost than if there were multiple firms in the industry.
- Governments regulates these natural monopolies instead of breaking it up
- The ATC is downwards everywhere and the MC is a low constant value

![[natural monopolies.png]]
- $Q_{M}$ is MR = MC
- $Q_{E}$ is MB = MC
- To increase quantity produced, a price ceiling at the MC can be imposed. However, since  [[profit]] = Q(P-ATC) = PS - FC, the firm will lose money and that is bad. So the government will provide a per unit subsidy.
- Instead, a price ceiling at the ATC is used because it is more beneficial. The [[profit]] = 0  but the $Q_{ATC} < Q_{E}$.

# Oligopoly
Competition between small number of firms with a significant barrier to entry.

A firm's strategy impacts profits and competitor's impact.
- Game theory is important in studying oligopolies - how firms will behave
