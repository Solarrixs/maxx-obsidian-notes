# Externalities
Externality is the side effect on bystanders whose interests are not taken into account. This leads to failure, producing inefficient outcomes.

Externalities cause conflicts between **private interest (costs and benefits we occur)** and **society's interest (costs and benefits of other people)**.

Even though in perfectly competitive markets, it is efficient (MB = MC), we don't take into account externalities. Therefore, we want to find the socially efficient outcome (outcome efficient for all of society's costs and benefits). Therefore:
- star Socially efficient outcome occurs when social [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] = social [[marginal cost]]

## Negative externality
### Producers
Negative externality - an activity whose side effects harm bystanders
- ex Exhaust from your car harms others who breathe in your pollution

There are private [[marginal cost]] and external [[marginal cost]]. Sellers account for private MC but not external MC, which is the harm that negative externalities (pollution) impose on bystanders.

The firm's private cost and external cost = marginal social cost
- star MSC = private MC + external MC

![[negative externalities.png]]
- MSC is above the supply curve ([[marginal cost]]) with a difference equal to the external MC

### Consumers
Negative externalities can also be caused by consumers
- ex Smoking cigarettes

- star Marginal social benefit (MSB) = private [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] - external [[marginal cost]] (MSB = MB - MEC)

### Consequences
Negative externalities lead to overproduction.

![[consequence of negative production externality.png]]
- Since efficient quantity < quantity market, there is overproduction

## Positive externality
### Consumers
Positive externality - an activity whose side effects benefits bystanders
- ex Getting a COVID19 shots makes you and other people less likely to get sick

- star Social [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] = MB + external MB

![[positive externalities.png]]
- The external MB is included in social MB, which is why the social MB is above the [[demand curve]], and the wedge between them reflects the external MB

### Producers
- Social [[marginal cost]] = MC - external MB
