# Consumer Choice
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.


# Price Elasticity
The [[price elasticity of demand]] measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. The [[cross-price elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another. The [[income elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive your demand for a good is to changes in your income.

Understanding price elasticity for a good can determine pricing and total revenues. Given that seller revenue = consumer expenditure = $P \times Q$ and $E_{D} \times \% \text{ change in price}$ = $\% \text{ change in } Q_{D}$.
- star Total revenue and elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even if the slope is constant. As elasticity = $\Delta Q$/$Q_{\text{average}}$ / $\Delta P$/$P_{\text{average}}$ , you can calculate that higher points on a slope have elastic demand while lower points on a slope have inelastic demand.

When 2 [[demand curve|demand curves]] cross at the same point, the flatter line is the more [[elastic demand]] curve, and the steeper line is the more [[inelastic demand]] curve.

Change in consumption for a good is caused by [[substitution effects]] and [[income effects]].
