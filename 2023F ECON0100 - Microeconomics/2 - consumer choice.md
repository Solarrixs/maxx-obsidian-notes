# Consumer Choice
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.
