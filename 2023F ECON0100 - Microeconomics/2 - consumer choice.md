# Consumer Choice
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.


# Price Elasticity
The [[price elasticity of demand]] measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. The [[cross-price elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another. The [[income elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive your demand for a good is to changes in your income.

If the price of good A falls, then substitution and income effects occur:
- If the price of good A falls, then one can achieve the same level of utility by substituting good A for good B.
- If the price of good A falls, then one has more purchasing power for good A and will obtain a higher level of utility as one can buy more of good A (if it is a normal good and not an inferior good).

Understanding price elasticity for a good can determine pricing and total revenues. Given that revenue = $P \times Q$ and $E_{D} \times \% \text{ change in price}$ = $\% \text{ change in } Q_{D}$.
- star Total revenue and elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even if the slope is constant.

When 2 [[demand curve|demand curves]] cross at the same point, the flatter line is the more [[elastic demand]] curve, and the steeper line is the more [[inelastic demand]] curve.
