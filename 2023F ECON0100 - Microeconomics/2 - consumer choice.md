# Consumer Choice
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.

The price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. By what percent will the quantity demanded change in response to a 1% price change.

Price elasticity of demand $(E_{D})$ = $\frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}}$
- This should be a negative number due to the law of demand but absolute value is taken to see the magnitude of change.

To find percentage change in economics, we take the price or quantity change divided by the average value of price or quantity times 100
- ex If 9 pizzas are bought at $20.50 and 11 pizzas are bought at $19.50, then $-\frac{1}{20} \times 100 = -5\%$ is the percentage change in price
- ex $\frac{2}{10} \times 100 = 20\%$ is the percentage change in quantity demanded
- ex $E_{D} = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{20\%}{-5\%} = -4$

If $E_{D} > 1$, then demand is elastic as quantity is responsive. Price increases lead to larger changes in quantity demanded.

If $E_{D} < 1$, then demand is inelastic as quantity is not responsive. Price increases lead to larger changes in quantity demanded.

When 2 [[demand curve|demand curves]] cross at the same point, the flatter line is the more elastic demand curve.

Perfectly inelastic demand is if the demand curve is vertical, while perfectly elastic demand is if the demand curve is horizontal.

Determinants of the price elasticity of demand:
1. Availability of substitutes. Greater substitutes makes it easier to switch consumption of goods in response to a price increase, so greater elasticity.
2. If the amount spent on a good makes a large % of one's income, the person will be more sensitive to a change in price.
3. The longer we have to adjust to a price change, the more elastic demand will be.

% change in quantity demanded = $E_{D} \times$ % change in price
Total revenue = $P \times Q$

That means higher prices lead to less total revenue if demand is elastic.
That means higher prices lead to more total revenue if demand is inelastic.
Total revenues stay the same if demand is at unit elasticity.

Total revenue and elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even if the slope is constant.

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another:
- Cross-price elasticity of demand between goods A and B = $\dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}\text{ of }A}{\%\Delta B_{\text{price}}}$
- If positive, then you know two goods are substitutes, then you buy more of a good when the price of another good goes up. A small cross-price elasticity means the goods aren't close substitutes.
- If negative, then you know two goods are complements, then you buy less of a good when the price of another good goes up

Cross-price elasticity is positive for substitutes (such as cars and public transportation), then people buy more of a good when the price of the substitute increases.

The income elasticity of demand measures how responsive your demand for a good is to changes in your income.
- Income elasticity of demand = $\dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta P}$
- Income elasticity of demand is positive for normal goods (goods you buy more of when your income goes up) and is usually 1.
- Income elasticity of demand is negative for inferior goods.
- Luxury goods are normal goods that have a large income elasticity of demand, while necessities have small income elasticities.

If the price of good A falls, then substitution and income effects occur:
- If the price of good A falls, then one can achieve the same level of utility by substituting good A for good B.
- If the price of good A falls, then one has more purchasing power for good A and will obtain a higher level of utility as one can buy more of good A.
	- However, if purchasing power increases because the price of a good falls, but the consumption still decreases, that good must be an inferior good.
