# Consumer Choice
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

# Consumer Choice 2
An individual's demand curve can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good. You will get data for price to quantity demanded, which can be plotted.
- Quantity demanded is higher when price is lower

Demand curve is also the marginal benefit curve
- Diminishing marginal benefit explains why your demand curve is downward sloping
- Marginal benefit is the maximum amount a person is willing to pay for one more unit of good

There is also a change in demand - at each price level, the quantity demanded changes

A market demand curve plots the total quantity of a good demanded by all potential buyers at each price.
- At each price, the total quantity demanded is the sum of quantity demanded by each individual

Changes in change occurs when:
- taste and preferences change
- income
- prices of related goods - substitute and complementary goods
- buyer expectations about future prices
- number of buyers

consumer surplus is the gain you get from buying something at a price below your willingness to pay, which is your marginal benefit
- consumer surplus = marginal benefit - price

total consumer surplus is the integral of a demand curve at the price level
the area below that is the consumer's total expenditures
total consumer surplus + total expenditures = total benefit
