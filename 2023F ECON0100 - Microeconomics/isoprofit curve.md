For a level of [[profit]] $k$, the equation of the isoprofit curve is $P = ATC + \dfrac{k}{q}$

![[profit curves.png|500]]

Isoprofit curves follow the same pattern as [[average costs]] curves:
- Downward sloping when price above the [[marginal cost]] curve
- Upward sloping when price below the [[marginal cost]] curve
- Minimum when they intersect the marginal cost curve

The difference between price and marginal cost is the profit margin.
