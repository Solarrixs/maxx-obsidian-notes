Deadweight loss is calculated as:
- [[economic surplus]] at the $q_{e}$ - economic surplus at the profit maximizing quantity
- area between the MC and MB curves at $q_{e}$ and $q$

Deadweight loss occurs when the market is at market failure, or when firms aren't producing at Pareto efficiency.

Deadweight loss is an arrowhead pointed at the efficient quantity.
- Thus, if [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] > [[marginal cost]], production should be increased to reach $q_{e}$
Quantities rather than price are essential to measuring deadweight loss.
