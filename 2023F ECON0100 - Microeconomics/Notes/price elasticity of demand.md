$(E_{D})$ = $\dfrac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}} = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta P}$.
- This should be a negative number due to the law of demand but **absolute value** is taken to see the magnitude of change.

$E_{D}$ measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes.
- If $E_{D} > 1$: [[elastic demand]] as quantity is responsive (flatter slope).
- If $E_{D} < 1$: [[inelastic demand]] as quantity is not responsive (steeper slope).
- If $E_{D} = 1$: [[unit elastic demand]].
- If $E_{D} = \infty$: perfectly elastic demand, firm is a price-taker and has no market power and its marginal revenue = price.
- If $E_{D} = 0$: perfectly inelastic demand.

## Determinants
1. Availability of substitutes. More substitutes makes it easier to switch consumption of goods in response to a price increase, so there is a greater elasticity.
2. If the amount spent on a good makes a large % of one's income, the person will be more sensitive to a change in price and so there is greater elasticity.
3. The longer we have to adjust to a price change, the more elastic demand will be.
