Is the slope of the [[total product of labor]] graph and written as:

$MP_{L} = \dfrac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}$
- Change in total product over change in quantity of labor

The marginal product of labor can be plotted to see the optimal quantity of labor. At some point, the increasing marginal return of additional laborers will reach a local maximum and lead to decreasing marginal returns.
- Increasing marginal returns is due to specialization of tasks by additional workers, which enhances productivity
- Decreasing marginal returns is due to less capital resources for each worker to use - called the law of diminishing marginal returns
