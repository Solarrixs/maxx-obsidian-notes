Has a [[price elasticity of demand]] of $\infty$, and thus has a horizontal demand curve.

Has no market power and its [[marginal revenue]] = price.

The break-even price is the minimum of the [[average costs|average total cost curve]] where the MC = ATC.
- The break-even price is also the long-run equilibrium price

The shut-down price is when the profit-maximizing quantity at $MR = MC$ will be such that $P \leq AVC$.
- Thus, for a perfectly competitive price-taker firm, the shut-down price is the minimum of the AVC where AVC = MC

The market supply curve is the [[marginal cost]] above the shut-down price.
- Thus, the supply curve is $P=MC$, and solve for $Q$, only if it is above the shut-down price, so if it is above $AVC=MC$.

## Market Supply
Determinants of supply curve:
- Change in variable cost: increase VC = decrease supply = leftward shift of supply curve
- Change in productivity/technology: more efficient = decrease VC = increase supply
- Seller Expectation: if price is expected to increase in the future, then current supply decrease
- Number of sellers: higher firms = increase supply = flatter (elastic) supply
