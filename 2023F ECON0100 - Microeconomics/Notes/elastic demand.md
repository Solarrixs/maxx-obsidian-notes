[[price elasticity of demand]] $(E_{D})$ = $\dfrac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}} > 1$

Price increases lead to larger changes in quantity demanded. That means higher prices lead to less total revenue if demand is elastic.

There is a case of perfectly elastic demand: if the [[demand curve]] is horizontal.
