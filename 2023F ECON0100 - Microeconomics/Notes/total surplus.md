Area between:
- [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] and [[marginal cost]]
- Sum of [[producer surplus]] and [[consumer surplus]]

Allows for more surplus than the profit maximizing point and is Pareto Efficient but will never work without government intervention.

- Total surplus and maximum efficiency occurs when $MB \text{ (demand curve)}= MC$
- Moving away from $q_{e}$ will lead to inefficiency, decrease total surplus, and create deadweight loss.
