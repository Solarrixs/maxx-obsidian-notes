This measures how responsive [[price-taker firm|price taking firms]] are to price changes, measured with:
$E_{S} = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$

If the price elasticity of supply > 1, then it is elastic; otherwise inelastic.
A perfectly elastic supply is a horizontal line.
- The more flexible a firm is, the greater its price elasticity of supply is, such as having more inventory, easily available variable inputs, over longer time

An elastic supply curve starts from the y-axis
An inelastic supply curve starts from the x-axis
