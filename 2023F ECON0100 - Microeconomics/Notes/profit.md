Total economic profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. So if a business produces quantity $q$, accounting profit is written as:
- $\pi = TR(q) - TC(q)$, where $TC(q) = FC + VC(q)$ and $TR(q) = P \times q$
- $\pi(q) = q \times (P-ATC)$

Economic cost also includes implicit [[opportunity cost]], including the opportunity cost of forgone wages and forgone interest and is written as:
- Economic profit = Revenue - Costs - Opportunity Cost

The maximum profit is when [[marginal revenue]] equals [[marginal cost]].

Profit can be graphed onto the [[isoprofit curve]].
