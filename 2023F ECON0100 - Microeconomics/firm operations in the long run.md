Also see: [[firm operations in the short run]]

Long run means you don't have to pay your fixed costs so you can exit the market as you can avoid paying your fixed costs. From there, you or your rivals can expand or contract production capacity.

In the long run, when competitors enter the market:
- A firm will lose customers to competitions and shift the [[demand curve]] inwards
- [[price elasticity of demand]] depends on availability of substitutes, and thus demand curve becomes more elastic and flatter

Thus, firm's profit will decrease because it sells at a lower quantity at a lower price with a lower price margin. Eventually, in the long run equilibrium, competitors will have no economic profits. **Long run profits are always 0.**
- This will only shift demand and MR curves
- This means AC (average cost) curve will be at the demand curve
- This will cause firms to "exit"

- star If $\pi<0$, firms will exit in the long run., increasing firm demand and causing [[inelastic demand]].

- star If $\pi>0$, firms will join in the long run, lowering firm demand (less customers) and causing [[elastic demand]] to flatten the demand curve, therefore the firm loses market power to set prices. Long run is reached so demand curve is tangent to the ATC curve.

Long-run profitability depends on barriers to entry.

Production always occur in the elastic part of the [[demand curve]], not the inelastic part.

It is important to note that having an economic profit of 0 isn't bad for a firm - it means it is earning an accounting profit equal to its opportunity costs. This is called making normal profits.
