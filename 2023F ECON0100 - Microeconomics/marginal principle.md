The marginal principle says that decisions about quantities are best made incrementally. Marginal indicates a difference between alternatives that represents only 1 unit more. **For example, should I stay one more day at vacation and pay one more night of expenses?**

The benefit you get from staying one more night is the marginal benefit, and the extra cost of that night is the marginal cost. In this situation, you should only compare the marginal benefits and costs.

Essentially, keep doing an action as long as your marginal benefits equal your marginal costs.
