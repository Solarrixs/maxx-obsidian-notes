The gain you get from buying something at a price below your willingness to pay, which is your marginal benefit
- consumer surplus = marginal benefit - price

Total consumer surplus is the integral of a [[demand curve]] a certain price level. The total area underneath that is the consumer's total expenditure. Total consumer surplus + total expenditures = total benefit people get from that good at that price.
