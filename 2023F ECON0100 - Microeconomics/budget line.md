The budget line shows all available consumption bundles that is obtainable on an [[optimal consumption choice curve]].
- Budget lines can shift up and down depending on price of goods or change in income
- The slope of the budget line is the relative prices of the two goods: the [[opportunity cost]] of good Y in terms of good X

The budget line can be calculated with:
$$
P_{x}X + P_{y}Y = \text{Budget}
$$
- And calculate $X$ and $Y$ assuming the other variable is 0 to get the X and Y intercepts
