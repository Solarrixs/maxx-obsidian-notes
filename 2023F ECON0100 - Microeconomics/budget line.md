The budget line shows all available consumption bundles that is obtainable on an [[optimal consumption choice curve]].
- Budget lines can shift up and down depending on price of goods or change in income
- The slope of the budget line is the relative prices of the two goods: the [[opportunity cost]] of good Y in terms of good X

The budget line can be calculated with:
$$
P_{x}X + P_{y}Y = \text{Income } (I)
$$
$$
y=\frac{I}{P_{y}}-\frac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}
$$

- X and Y intercepts are $\dfrac{I}{P_{y}}$ and $\dfrac{I}{P_{x}}$ and the slope is $-\dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}$
