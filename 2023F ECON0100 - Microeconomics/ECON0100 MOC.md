# Basics of Economics
In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the [[scarcity principle]] and its results. People can make choices based on the [[cost-benefit principle]], avoiding [[sunk costs]], and applying the [[marginal principle]] with the overall goal of obtaining an [[economic surplus]].

The [[scarcity principle]] causes each decision to have an [[opportunity cost]].

Thus, people must make choices to best use the [[scarce resources]] available.

As a whole, society relies on the [[interdependence principle]] to make decisions beneficial for all of society.

# Economic Models
- ! Unknown if this is studied in class
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions

# Consumer Choice

## Indifference Curves
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

## Optimal Consumption Choice Curve
A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

## Demand Curves
An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.

# Price Elasticity

## 3 Types of Price Elasticities
The [[price elasticity of demand]] measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. The [[cross-price elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another. The [[income elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive your demand for a good is to changes in your income.

## Price Elasticity Determines Revenue
Understanding price elasticity for a good can determine pricing and total revenues. Given that seller revenue = consumer expenditure = $P \times Q$ and $E_{D} \times \% \text{ change in price}$ = $\% \text{ change in } Q_{D}$.
- star Total revenue and elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even if the slope is constant. As elasticity = $\Delta Q$/$Q_{\text{average}}$ / $\Delta P$/$P_{\text{average}}$ , you can calculate that higher points on a slope have elastic demand while lower points on a slope have inelastic demand.

When 2 [[demand curve|demand curves]] cross at the same point, the flatter line is the more [[elastic demand]] curve, and the steeper line is the more [[inelastic demand]] curve.

### Midpoint Average
To calculate $E_{D}$, you need to take the percent change by taking the price or quantity change divided by the average value of price or quantity times 100.

$\Delta\% = \dfrac{\text{final - initial}}{average}$

- ex If 9 pizzas are bought at $20.50 and 11 pizzas are bought at $19.50, then $-\frac{1}{20} \times 100 = -5\%$ is the percentage change in price
- ex $\frac{2}{10} \times 100 = 20\%$ is the percentage change in quantity demanded
- ex $E_{D} = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{20\%}{-5\%} = -4$

## Price Changes Lead to Total Effects
When a price of a good changes, there is [[substitution effects]] (change in price ratio) and [[income effects]] (a change in purchasing power shifts the budget line), resulting in a [[total effect]]. Either the income effect or the substitution effect dominates the total effect based on the changes in consumptions reflected by the goods. A special case of total effect is a [[griffen good]].

# Behavioral Economists
Standard economists relies on the assumption that people are rational. However, psychology shows that people are predictably irrational. Thus, behavioral economics was born.

Irrational decisions are based on the [[anchoring effect]], [[status quo bias]], and [[faulty discounting]].

# Seller Choice
Resources like labor and capital equipment to produce goods and services are inputs (factors of production), while goods and services are outputs. The relationship between quantity of inputs used and quantity of outputs produced is the production function.

## Products of Labor
The [[marginal product of labor]] is the slope of the [[total product of labor]] graph, which allows one to determine the optimal amount of laborers to hire before there is a diminishing marginal return on labor.

When graphed, x-axis is the amount of labor and y-axis is the production.

The [[average product of labor]] measures the productivity of workers and holds a special relationship with the marginal product of labor:
- When $AP_{L}$​ is increasing: $MP_{L} > AP_{L}$
- When $AP_{L}$​ is decreasing: $MP_{L} < AP_{L}$
- When $AP_{L}$​ is constant because $AP_{L}$ is at a maximum: $MP_{L} = AP_{L}$

The implication is that when a more productive worker is hired, average product rises. Conversely, when a less productive worker is hired, average product falls.

## Costs and Outputs
Costs that do not vary with output are fixed. Fixed costs are either "avoidable costs" or "sunk costs," so total $FC = \text{sunk FC + avoidable FC}$.

Costs that vary with output are variable costs. Usually, variable costs increases as production increases (but doesn't mean they increase in the same proportion).

Total cost is $TC = \text{VC + FC}$.
- Fixed costs is the distance between the total and variable cost curves

![[total, variable, and fixed costs graph.png|400]]

The [[marginal cost]] is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.

There are also three [[average costs]] of production. When all costs and output functions are combined, [[cost functions]] can be analyzed.

When graphed, x-axis is the production and y-axis is the costs.

# Demand and Isoprofit Curves
For any individual product, the [[demand curve#Product Demand Curve|product demand curve]] determines the quantity of product purchased at each possible price.

All businesses aim to maximize [[profit]]. This can be done by choosing the [[isoprofit curve]] tangent to the [[demand curve]]. Profit maximization can also be done using [[marginal analysis]] on [[marginal revenue]].

This only works in a monopolistic competition model, where products are differentiated products. Each firm for each product faces downward sloping demand. If there is many similar products, each firm would have [[elastic demand]].

Understand [[firm operations in the short run]] and [[firm operations in the long run]].

# Pareto Efficiency
True [[total surplus]] is always more than the profit-maximizing point. Reaching Pareto Efficiency requires government intervention because all firms would take the highest [[profit]] rather than highest total surplus. This will cause [[deadweight loss]].

- & Here, point E is profit maximizing point ([[marginal revenue]] intersects with [[marginal cost]], then the maximizing price point is chosen at the [[demand curve]])
