# Basics of Economics
In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the [[scarcity principle]] and its results. People can make choices based on the [[cost-benefit principle]], avoiding [[sunk costs]], and applying the [[marginal principle]] with the overall goal of obtaining an [[economic surplus]].

The [[scarcity principle]] causes each decision to have an [[opportunity cost]].

Thus, people must make choices to best use the [[scarce resources]] available.

As a whole, society relies on the [[interdependence principle]] to make decisions beneficial for all of society.

# Economic Models
- ! Unknown if this is studied in class
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions

# Consumer Choice
## Indifference Curves
Consumers face a **constrained optimization** problem to maximize [[consumer utility]]. The **positive** change in utility is called [[marginal utility]]. However, marginal utility offers diminishing returns.

An [[indifference curve]] represents a consumer's optimal consumption choice (that maximizes [[consumer utility]]). From the indifference curve, you can calculate a person's willingness to give up one good to get 1 more unit of another good. This is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]].

## Optimal Consumption Choice Curve
A person can only obtain bundles of goods on an indifference curve if it is within the [[budget line]]. By combining the indifference curve with the budget line, you obtain the [[optimal consumption choice curve]].

## Demand Curves
An individual's and market [[demand curve]] can be plotted by finding the optimal consumption choice at different prices of a good.

There is also a [[change in demand]] and [[consumer surplus]]. Customer income will also change whether customers buy normal goods or inferior goods.

# Price Elasticity
## 3 Types of Price Elasticities
The [[price elasticity of demand]] measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. The [[cross-price elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another. The [[income elasticity of demand]] measures how responsive your demand for a good is to changes in your income.

## Price Elasticity Determines Revenue
Understanding price elasticity for a good can determine pricing and total revenues. Given that seller revenue = consumer expenditure = $P \times Q$ and $E_{D} \times \% \text{ change in price}$ = $\% \text{ change in } Q_{D}$.
- star Total revenue and elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even if the slope is constant. As elasticity = $\Delta Q$/$Q_{\text{average}}$ / $\Delta P$/$P_{\text{average}}$ , you can calculate that higher points on a slope have elastic demand while lower points on a slope have inelastic demand.

When 2 [[demand curve|demand curves]] cross at the same point, the flatter line is the more [[elastic demand]] curve, and the steeper line is the more [[inelastic demand]] curve.

## Price Changes Lead to Total Effects
When a price of a good changes, there is [[substitution effects]] (change in price ratio) and [[income effects]] (a change in purchasing power shifts the budget line), resulting in a [[total effect]]. Either the income effect or the substitution effect dominates the total effect based on the changes in consumptions reflected by the goods. A special case of total effect is a [[griffen good]].

# Behavioral Economists
Standard economists relies on the assumption that people are rational. However, psychology shows that people are predictably irrational. Thus, behavioral economics was born.

Irrational decisions are based on the [[anchoring effect]], [[status quo bias]], and [[faulty discounting]].
