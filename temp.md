I'm drawn to VC because it resonates with my entrepreneurial spirit. Having started my own startup, I want to understand and learn what makes a startup successful. What metrics are tracked? What values are prioritized? By joining the VC space at Pegasus' Scout Program, I see an opportunity to benefit:

Myself, by understanding what, why, and how some startups succeed and why 90% fail, and what angel investors and accelerators look for in a startup.

The Pegasus' Scout Program team, by contributing my unique insights in biotechnology (having conducted 5 years of biotech-related research) startup experience, and by bringing my analytical skills and financial literacy gained from pursuing a double degree at UPenn Engineering and Wharton.

I have experience in founding/co-founding two startups. The first is a B2B SaaS platform to streamline research paper management and analysis using AI. Because of my extensive background in research, I was able to conduct impactful user interviews with researchers in established facilities, such as in Stanford, Penn Med, and other universities, while my technical co-founder developed the service. We raised $100k pre-seed from 1517 Fund. My second is a deeptech startup in creating extremely energy-efficient semiconductors using emerging neuroengineering and nanotechnology techniques. Because of my extensive background in research, I have the expertise necessary to pursue this deeptech startup, and have collaboration with multiple research institutions. I am currently in the process of raising money for R&D.

I am also interning at a B2B SaaS startup this winter and summer aiming to develop an all-in-one platform for small business management.

Finally, I'm involved in multiple startup and entrepreneurship clubs and programs in my university. At Wharton, I'm part of the Venture Capital club and Penn Social Entrepreneurship Club, and have direct connections within the entrepreneurship board at the Wharton Fintech club.

1. For a newly established startup, I'm looking for startups that solve a real and feasible market. That means a strong positive signal from user studies, and potentially existing solutions in that market.

2. I'm looking for a diverse founder team that simply can work together and bring different skill sets. The founders should also have some qualifications for why they are able to build their product - usually 1 technical founder at the minimum and 1 founder with personal experience in their problem domain.

3. For an early-stage company with established metrics, I evaluate their potential for success by their growth rate. Because a good business first and foremost is creating a valuable good or service, signified by an increasing growth rate (not growth!) Because a company growing 1% weekly vs. 5% weekly is a massive difference at the end of the year. Even if the company is currently struggling with low growth rates, if every iteration or pivot leads to an increase in growth rates, I trust they are slowly optimizing towards market fit.

Recently, I made the difficult decision to cut my friend from my deeptech startup. Initially, I accepted him as my "co-founder" (we didn't establish equity/roles at the time) because I felt that I needed help to have my startup running. However, very quickly I realized that I should have done more due diligence before accepting co-founders to work alongside me. We had opposing ideas, different commitments, and different expectations.

At first, I wasn't sure about cutting him from my startup. I used the binstack framework I learned from @ASmartBear and understood that this was something that wouldn't benefit from being "nice" and afraid of the outlash it may result. The longer I kept this desire hidden, the more it would come to bite back at me.

I told him the honest reason why I couldn't work with him and explained how it was my fault in not being more diligent. The outcome turned out better than I thought it would have - he agreed that the novelty of working in a startup has worn off and understood that he wasn't as committed as I was. So even though we aren't "co-founders" anymore, we remain friends.

I think this was the best outcome for the both of us. It relieved my mental uncertainties and prevented this from escalating to a much bigger problem in the future, which allowed us to remain as friends.
