Cost functions can be determined based on total, variable, and fixed costs, their average complements, and the [[marginal cost]].

Given:
- $TC_{q} = 100 + 10q + q^2$ and $MC_{q} = 10 + 2q$
- Then FC is part of the total cost that doesn't change: $100$
- Then VC is the part of total cost that does change: $10q + q^2$
- AFC, AVC, ATC can be calculated by dividing FC, VC, and TC by $q$
- Minimum of AVC and ATC is when these curves intersect the marginal cost so $AVC = MC \text{ and } ATC = MC$

70 + 5q2 = 0
