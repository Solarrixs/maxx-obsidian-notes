Also see: [[firm operations in the long run]]

Short run means you have to pay your fixed costs so you cannot leave the market as you cannot avoid paying your fixed costs.

If $VC < TR$, it is better for a firm to operate at a loss than shutting down. It can also be said if $TR > VC \leftrightarrow PS > 0$ or if $AVC < P$ (average variable cost) then the firm should operate at a loss (or "shut down").

If $\pi < 0$, then the profit loss is $TC-TR$ or $P < ATC$.
If you decide to not produce anything $(q=0)$, you still occur fixed costs.

Therefore:
- star Shutdown if $TR < VC \leftrightarrow P < AVC$
- star Operate if $TR > VC \leftrightarrow P > AVC$

The difference between total revenue and variable cost is the [[producer surplus]], which is the opposite idea of [[consumer surplus]].
