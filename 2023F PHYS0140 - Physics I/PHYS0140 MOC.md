# Kinematics
Kinematic formulas:
$$
v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t}
$$
$$
a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
$$
v = v_{x}i + v_{y}j + v_{z}k
$$
$$
a = a_{x}i + a_{y}j + a_{z}k
$$
$$
\text{Speed} = |v| = \sqrt{ v_{x}^2 + v_{y}^2}
$$
$$
\text{Height} = \frac{v^2\sin^2\theta}{2g}
$$$$
\text{Time} = \frac{2v\sin\theta}{g}
$$
$$
\text{Range} = \frac{v^2\sin 2\theta}{g}
$$

Acceleration can be broken down into Normal and Tangential components: $a_{\parallel}$ (speed) and $a_{\perp}$ (direction).

Velocity is tangent to position vector.
Acceleration is perpendicular to position vector.

# Newton's Laws
1. Object in motion or rest stays in motion or rest unless acted by an external force
2. $\Sigma F = ma$ (gravity, normal, friction, tension)
3. Opposite and equal reactions on different objects

## Tips to Solve Systems
1. Find forces on all objects and write $\Sigma F$
2. Determine any acceleration
