# Introduction
What is Big Brother? [[The Global Police State.pdf#page=5&selection=11,38,12,55]]

- ! "George Orwell got it wrong" means that it isn't totalitarian states that are bad, but actually democratic governments that cause problems.

The Core, Peripherals, and the Outliers reflect current society and the uneven distribution of wealth. Wealth is power, and power allows for political control.

- ? New technology might allow resources to be used to create a better political and economic system... how? Expanding social media presence to the surplus, open source designs, and 3D printing? Does that lessen the reliance on the wealthy for products?

- ? Automation is going to remove boring and demeaning work, but what will the displaced workers do if those jobs didn't exist?

Global capitalism is oppressive and an archaic system based on social relations. Replacing it with the newer tech can somehow meet the material and spiritual needs of humanity.
- I think this is something extremely hard to do simply because capitalism is so prevalent around the world, and most people in the West will have a positive view of this system anyways
- Is the author arguing that political, economic, and social circumstances are leading to the rise of socialism and fascism again?
- star I think the **main proposition of the book is to propose the ultimate goal of replacing the current global capitalist system to avert disaster and be more beneficial and sustainable for the surplus humans by meeting their spiritual and material needs - both economic well-being and emotional satisfaction**
- star Another purpose is to **identify and explore capitalism and its new forms, and how it contributes to a global police state that interacts with the economic, political, ideological, and military dimensions with the goal of coercive exclusion of surplus humanity**
- The new technology isn't being used to liberate humanity from capitalism but is being applied by agents of capitalism to bring about a global police state

A police state consists of:
- Police and military repression
- Authoritarian government
- Suppression of civil liberties and human rights

While this exists in many countries, this is emerging within the global economy and society (3 reasons):
- Mass social control, repression, and warfare by ruling groups to contain the potential rebellion of the global working class (surplus humanity) [[The Global Police State.pdf#page=7&selection=9,0,11,73]]
	- ex Border control, deportation regimes, mass incarceration, state and private surveillance, criminalization of the poor and working class through state-sanctioned repression that opens new profit-making opportunities for the "Core"
- Global economy is based more on the development of systems of warfare, social control, and repression to make profit. Or "accumulation by repression".
	- ? What's an real life example of this?
	- ? So in areas of extreme global inequalities, it is maintained by social control and oppression?
	- & So essentially the US is encouraging wars and generating and sustaining social conflict (state sponsored violence) is on purpose to expand systems of warfare, repression, surveillance, and social control? War can make manufacturing companies produce more weapons and encourage more research and development into those areas. They can also profit from defense contracts, expand their markets, suppress dissent through drafts, or divert public attention?
	- & Perhaps in times of social or political unrest, there might be opportunities for powerful entities to take advantage of economic resources that were previously unavailable due to public resistance. Repression can allow them to maintain the status quo and continue exploiting resources for their own benefit.
- Increasing move toward political systems than can be characterized as fascism or totalitarian.
	- Influence of neo-fascist, authoritarian movements such as Trumpism.
	- Neo-fascist culture is also emerging through militarism, misogyny, masculinization, and racism. This culture is prone to mass violence towards the racially and ethnically oppressed, women, poor, and other vulnerable communities.

In a simple sense, the global police state is a story of control and repression against poor and working classes - the surplus humans.
- ex Expressions of global police state: mass incarceration, police violence, US led wars, persecution of immigrants and refugees and other groups.
- ? How is the repression of environmental justice activists related with this topic?

# Chapter 1
Capitalism's values of maximizing profit and expanding outwardly drives colonialism and imperialism. This has remained for centuries.

But capitalism has changed continuously is the social formations and technologies which capitalism operates on, and the institutions and class relations that organize the system.

- star Right now, capitalism is becoming a global police state.

## First Stage of Capitalism
Symbolized by the conquest of the Americas in 1492 is the epoch of **mercantilism and primitive accumulation.**

Marked by the creation of a world market, the colonial system, and a trans-Atlantic economy.

## Second Stage of Capitalism
**Competitive or classical capitalism** is marked by the Industrial Revolution, the bourgeoisie, and the creation of modern nation-states like the American and French Revolution

## Third Stage of Capitalism
**National corporate monopoly capitalism** is marked by imperialist conquest and the rise of powerful national financial and industrial corporations. This becomes global capitalism by the 1970s, where a transnational capital is created where all nations and most humans are integrated in a global production and financial system.

Computer technology and other advances has led to global reach and advance over the global working classes. Now, people can search for the cheapest labor, lowest taxes, and laxest regulatory environments in the entire global economy through outsourcing across the planet.

Therefore, a global economy emerges where everyone is integrated into this vast decentralized network of production, distribution, communication, and economy. This also led to the rise of a transnational capitalist class (TCC) as an agent of global capitalism, made up of owners and managers of giant transnational corporations and financial institutions that drive the global economy.
- ? So the TCC class has financial interest globally and organizes itself to pursue interests worldwide?
- '' The TCC directly instrumentalizes states around the world such that every country and the global economy is structurally dependent on transnational capital.
	- ? Any examples of these transnational companies or TCC?
	- & With that mutual corporation, states have to generate the conditions for transnational capital accumulation, and this means not only assuring a favorable climate for making profit but also repressing any threat to the rule of capital through social oppression

Capital in the world has been transnationally integrated and centralized within the TCC. Out of share ownership of public companies, core TNCs own each other companies, combining to own the majority of the world's revenues. 
- ex 17 global elites managed $41+ trillion, if not more.
- & So the great financial capital they have allows them to influence political and economic decisions worldwide? And countries make decisions together since these global elites influence many countries as they have money to influence many institutions on the TNS, such as advisors to international organizations like the World Bank, WTO, national governments, central banks, foreign affairs, defense, advisory roles to head of states, all to influence policies to protect their global capital. These policies are instructions to be followed by government puppets.
- star A global government system exists controlled by the TNCs as an oligarchy to force puppet nation-states to obey their rules of accumulating and retaining capital.

Primitive accumulation is where masses of people are violent separated from means of production (like land) such that it comes under control of capitalists. This forces people to join the capitalistic society.
- ex Britain's enclosure movement forced millions into the city to work as capitalistic workers.

Three types of capitalistic crisis:
1. Cyclical recessions
2. Structural crises - solution is to restructure the system every 50 years involving breakdown of state legitimacy, escalating class struggles, and military conflicts
3. Existential crisis posed by ecological limits to the reproduction of the system such as climate change, nitrogen cycle, diversity loss, and overall mass extinction due to the mass and accelerated commodification of nature
	- & So climate change activists are under persecution because it goes against the nature of capitalism and the commodification of nature
	- & Since capitalism is expansionary and has conquered all land in the world, where else can it expand to?
