The 3 average costs of production:
- Average fixed cost (AFC): total fixed cost per unit of output
- Average variable cost (AVC): total variable cost per unit of output
- Average total cost (ATC): total cost per unit of output

Because $TC = VC + FC$, dividing each term by quantity becomes $ATC = AVC + AFC$.
