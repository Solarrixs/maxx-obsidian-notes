The 3 average costs of production:
- Average fixed cost (AFC): total fixed cost per unit of output
- Average variable cost (AVC): total variable cost per unit of output
- Average total cost (ATC): total cost per unit of output

Because $TC = VC + FC$, dividing each term by quantity becomes $ATC = AVC + AFC$.

ATC and AVC curves are U-shaped because the size of fixed cost compared to the size of variable cost is large at low outputs but small at high outputs (because of diminishing returns on variable costs).

When [[marginal cost]] is below average cost, average cost must be falling, and when [[marginal cost]] exceeds average cost, average cost will increase. When [[marginal cost]] and average cost are equal, average cost must be at its minimum.
