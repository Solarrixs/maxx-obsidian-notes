Combine the [[budget line]] and the [[indifference curve]] to find out the optimal consumption choice.
- star The optimal bundle is under the budget line but on the highest indifference curve.

The optimal consumption bundle is when the indifference curve should be tangent (if slopes are equal) to the budget line. Thus:
$$
MRS_{xy} = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}
$$

- When two goods are perfect substitutes, the consumer will consume the good with a lower price.
- When two goods are perfect complements, they are consumed in the same rate in relation with each other.
