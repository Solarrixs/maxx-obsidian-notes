Author names, title and year of publication, purpose, proposition, methods/reasons/findings

- A summary does not judge or evaluate; it doesn't offer oneâ€™s personal opinion on the book.
- The summary should focus on the text's proposition and how the author develops it: main reasons, highlights, and the methodology used.
- Book summaries seldom provide specific details and almost never use direct quotations. They are works of paraphrase and condensation.
