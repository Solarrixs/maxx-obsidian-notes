In _When McKinsey Comes to Town (2022)_, Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe aim to expose the hidden influence of McKinsey in industries and governments around the world through multiple case studies that allow the general audience to understand. Through their analyses, Bogdanich and Forsythe investigate the control McKinsey has in many industries - from oil, pharmaceuticals, and even the government. Yet, throughout all sectors, McKinsey's expert management consulting advice usually leads to three strategies to satisfy corporate interests: product strategy, cost-cutting, or layoffs. Disturbingly, consultants employed by McKinsey recommend these strategies no matter the scenario, even if mass layoffs threaten worker safety - as illustrated during the U.S. Steel and Disneyland incidents - even if extreme cost-cutting threatens the lives of individuals - as faced by U.S. immigrants - even if their newly devised product and market strategies go against their values of ethics and creating a positive change in the world - as highlighted by their work with oil giants, China and Saudi Arabia governments. This disturbing pattern reveals how McKinsey operates behind its prestigious image. For McKinsey, they claim it is just business. But their actions have severe impacts on the ordinary people.
