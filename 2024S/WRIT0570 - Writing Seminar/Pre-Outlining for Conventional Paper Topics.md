- **How does James Cameron, director of Avatar, use color to create mood and characterization?**
    - Explanatory
    - To me, the "How" keyword asks me to explain the director's technique, not justify his use of his color techniques.

- **Why you are qualified for medical school, why you want it, what your long term goals are, etc.**
    - Justificatory
    - The "why you are... why you want..." keywords tells me that I need to justify my reason for applying, and that I'm not explaining what medical school is but why I want it.

- **Compare and contrast two books and make an assessment of current foreign policy in the Middle East.**
    - Both Explanatory and Justificatory?
    - The keyword compare and contrast is more explanatory, but make an assessment makes me think I also need to justify (or not) the current foreign policy of the Middle East.

- James Cameron uses color in "Avatar" to highlight the characters' differences and mood about their planets.
	- His use of vibrant blue for the people showcase their connection to the environment.
		- The similar colors of the people with the environment and planet sets a mood of wonder and respect for nature.
	- His use of color enhances the audience's understanding of the characters and what they stand for.
		- The blue skin is similar to the planet's life, which shows their relationship with the planet. However, the humans and their machines are drab gray and metallic colors showcase their lack of connection to the planet and nature.
