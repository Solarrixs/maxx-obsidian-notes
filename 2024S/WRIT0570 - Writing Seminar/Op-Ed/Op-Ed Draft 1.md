# Rhetorical Situation
Proposition: University educators should provide greater opportunities for students to pursue passion projects for self-learning.

Audience: Most likely university staff, including professors, educators, academic advisors, etc. They are most likely interested in helping students learn better, reforming the education system. University students interested in pursuing “better” forms of education for themselves, such as projects or gap year internships may also read.

Genre: An online 600 word editorial in a popular education-based publication targeted towards university staff and students thinking about education reform.

Motive of Author: As someone who wishes to go into engineering and entrepreneurship, both of which are widely regarded as very hands on and cannot be taught in a traditional school-based environment, I wish that Penn and other schools offered their students a greater degree of independent studies and projects that could still fulfill their academic credit limits. As a student myself, I recognize that most students see assignments and the current education system as “broken” and thus aim to game the system and view assignments as grade-focused only instead of learning opportunities. My motive is thus to convince students to pursue independent studies if possible, and for university faculty and administrators to consider a greater degree of supporting independent studies from students. My other motive is to write a compelling editorial that could get me published and all the benefits that come from that.

Motive of Reader: The reader is frustrated with the current educational system, whether they are staff or students, and want to seek ways to either help their students learn better or want to find other opportunities to learn (especially in a hands-on real-world environment). Such readers will be intrigued in my personal experiences with starting a passion project, and from an engineering/entrepreneurship POV, I believe I offer some unique perspectives on this idea.

Author’s Goal: To convince the reader that they should pursue passion projects or co-ops or gap year internships (students) or that expanding an independent study program or starting a co-op program is highly beneficial for students (educators), and that the current classroom based learning style is outdated.

Author’s Plan: To show the reader several anecdotal examples of learning a lot from passion projects, stats on what industries say about college students (they are ill-prepared) and stats about hiring rates after graduating college, references to other universities co-op or independent study programs.

Rhetorical Strategies: Anecdotes + stats. Emotional + rational appeal!

# Logical Outline
(Given) A university/college role is to help students learn.
(Given) Educators want to help their students learn the best they can.
(Given) Traditional education has a focus on grading, assignments, and rigid course structure that does not allow for the student to be flexible and take interesting courses.
(Given) A student within a university wants to graduate in 4 years and thus make the most of their time at university to learn and prepare for their future.
(Given) A major role of university is to prepare students for a future career.

(Thus) University staff, educators, and administrators should allow students to pursue project based, independent studies as a core of their course curriculum.

(Because) Traditional education contains rigid course selections that may not be in a student’s interest.
(For example) Many students complain about General Requirements that are not related to what they want to pursue.

(Because) Many traditional courses do not reflect the experiences in a real-world career environment.
(For example) Learning “entrepreneurship” by studying previous case-studies does not teach students to actually launch and run a business and the processes involved in it.

(Because) Students interested in their passion projects will rapidly learn more and provide a better learning experience reflective of a real-world career.
(For example) Personal anecdote of doing research and understanding biology versus a biology class.

(Because) University focuses too much on grading, leading to students achieving the highest grade rather than truly learning.
(For example) The rise of GPT and AI in education proves that assignments are viewed as mundane and unimportant to a student’s learning.

(Some may argue that) integrating project-based learning and independent studies into the existing curriculum poses significant logistical complexities, such as the need for specialized faculty expertise. However, many universities are often the greatest talent density in many fields compared to anywhere else. Additionally, schools could form strategic partnerships with industry, which would be beneficial for both the school, the industry, and the student.

(Granted), some subjects, particularly mathematics, naturally align with traditional learning methodologies due to the crucial need for a solid understanding of foundational principles. (However), encouraging students to apply concepts within their areas of interest can significantly deepen their grasp of why these subjects are essential. This rationale strengthens the case for supplementing traditional educational approaches with project-based learning.

# Rethinking Higher Education: Why Student Passion Projects Matter More Than Ever

As my first year at the University of Pennsylvania comes to a close, I find myself drawn towards what Mark Twain once said: "I'll never let my schooling get in the way of my education." In agreement, I have found that the traditional university curriculum - rigid, grade-focused, and lecture-based - to be ineffective for students growing up in the age of artificial intelligence.

One reason is because traditional rigid course structures, often fails to align with students' genuine interests and career aspirations. Many students (myself included) find themselves slogging through general requirements that bear little relevance to their intended paths. This one-size-fits-all approach simply dampens a student's enthusiasm for learning. In an era where information is at our fingertips, textbook memorization to pass exams seem archaic. Students need to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and those cannot be found in a textbook, but by doing. That means allowing students to pursue independent projects that counts towards their graduation requirements.

Another reason is that traditional classroom-based learning often falls short in preparing students for real-world experiences. Just recently, I was invited to a dinner with Contrary Venture Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm. We discussed about the effectiveness of Penn's Entrepreneurship classes and came to a single conclusion: working on 10 page "business canvas" worksheets simply does not prepare students for what entrepreneurship truly is.

As a student pursuing entrepreneurship by running my own startup, I am learning far beyond what traditional coursework can offer. From learning how to apply oscilloscope measurements to our computer software or designing and fabricating literal silicon chips in a cleanroom, or pitching to hundreds of investors and raising millions in funding, I have acquired not only a diversified skill set that I can apply to the real world, but also learn the many soft skills that can't be taught in drafting a 10 page worksheet: what it feels to "move fast and break things," working out cofounder disagreements, or dealing with the stress that inevitably comes when you're a month away from running out of cash.

Furthermore, by allowing students to pursue their own interests, students will take a personal initiative to dive deep and learn, ultimately leading to a better education. From my own experiences, I found AP Biology uninteresting and did the minimal amount of work to scrape by with an A. But that didn't mean I wasn't interested in biology. For six years of middle and high school, I eagerly dived into my own independent biology-focused neuroscience research at Stanford and Penn Medicine. Because my high school offered class credit for independent research, I was able to immerse myself in my research, gaining an extremely in-depth knowledge and levels beyond a typical AP Biology course, and my intrinsic motivation led to countless hours of dedicated effort outside the classroom.

Finally, a traditional university education focuses way too heavily on grading. What is broken with education is because it selects for GPA prestige and degree status over true education and learning. With the rise of AI, more students are and will use these technologies as a way to slog past their Gen Eds without regard to learning - all in the effort for the 4.0. In fact, I argue that the rise of GPT in education (and academia as well!) proves that these assignments are viewed as mundane and unimportant to one's learning.

Some may argue that integrating project-based learning and independent studies into the existing curriculum poses significant logistical complexities, such as the need for specialized faculty expertise. However, many universities are often the greatest talent density in many fields compared to anywhere else. Additionally, schools could form strategic partnerships with industry, which would be beneficial for the school, the industry, and the student. Moreover, independent studies should not be mandatory for all students. There should be a sufficient barrier in place to ensure that only motivated learners with the necessary literacy skills and problem-solving abilities pursue this path. By setting appropriate criteria, universities can maintain the integrity of these programs and prevent students from simply going through the motions.

Granted, some subjects, particularly mathematics, naturally align with traditional learning methodologies due to the crucial need for a solid understanding of foundational principles. However, encouraging students to apply concepts within their areas of interest can significantly deepen their grasp of why these subjects are essential. This rationale strengthens the case for supplementing traditional educational approaches with project-based learning. Instead of deterring universities from offering independent study opportunities, a balanced approach that combines traditional learning methods with project-based experiences can deepen students' understanding of the practical applications of these subjects.

It is time for universities, particularly well-resourced institutions like the Ivy League universities, to embrace that the traditional approach to education should be slowly phased out as artificial intelligence comes into play. Instead, a greater emphasis should be put on opportunities that allow students to pursue self-directed learning. Universities like Drexel and Northeastern have already recognized the value of real-world experience, offering acclaimed co-op programs that allow students to receive class credit while gaining professional exposure.
