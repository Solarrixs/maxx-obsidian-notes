# Rhetorical Situation
Proposition: University educators should provide greater opportunities for students to pursue passion projects for self-learning.

Audience: Most likely university staff, including professors, educators, academic advisors, etc. They are most likely interested in helping students learn better, reforming the education system. University students interested in pursuing “better” forms of education for themselves, such as projects or gap year internships may also read.

Genre: An online 600 word editorial in a popular education-based publication targeted towards university staff and students thinking about education reform.

Motive of Author: As someone who wishes to go into engineering and entrepreneurship, both of which are widely regarded as very hands on and cannot be taught in a traditional school-based environment, I wish that Penn and other schools offered their students a greater degree of independent studies and projects that could still fulfill their academic credit limits. As a student myself, I recognize that most students see assignments and the current education system as “broken” and thus aim to game the system and view assignments as grade-focused only instead of learning opportunities. My motive is thus to convince students to pursue independent studies if possible, and for university faculty and administrators to consider a greater degree of supporting independent studies from students. My other motive is to write a compelling editorial that could get me published and all the benefits that come from that.

Motive of Reader: The reader is frustrated with the current educational system, whether they are staff or students, and want to seek ways to either help their students learn better or want to find other opportunities to learn (especially in a hands-on real-world environment). Such readers will be intrigued in my personal experiences with starting a passion project, and from an engineering/entrepreneurship POV, I believe I offer some unique perspectives on this idea.

Author’s Goal: To convince the reader that they should pursue passion projects or co-ops or gap year internships (students) or that expanding an independent study program or starting a co-op program is highly beneficial for students (educators), and that the current classroom based learning style is outdated.

Author’s Plan: To show the reader several anecdotal examples of learning a lot from passion projects, stats on what industries say about college students (they are ill-prepared) and stats about hiring rates after graduating college, references to other universities co-op or independent study programs.

Rhetorical Strategies: Anecdotes + stats. Emotional + rational appeal!

# Logical Outline
(Given) A university/college role is to help students learn.
(Given) Educators want to help their students learn the best they can.
(Given) Traditional education has a focus on grading, assignments, and rigid course structure that does not allow for the student to be flexible and take interesting courses.
(Given) A student within a university wants to graduate in 4 years and thus make the most of their time at university to learn and prepare for their future.
(Given) A major role of university is to prepare students for a future career.

(Thus) University staff, educators, and administrators should allow students to pursue project based, independent studies as a core of their course curriculum.

(Because) Traditional education contains rigid course selections that may not be in a student’s interest.
(For example) Many students complain about General Requirements that are not related to what they want to pursue.

(Because) Many traditional courses do not reflect the experiences in a real-world career environment.
(For example) Learning “entrepreneurship” by studying previous case-studies does not teach students to actually launch and run a business and the processes involved in it.

(Because) Students interested in their passion projects will rapidly learn more and provide a better learning experience reflective of a real-world career.
(For example) Personal anecdote of doing research and understanding biology versus a biology class.

(Because) University focuses too much on grading, leading to students achieving the highest grade rather than truly learning.
(For example) The rise of GPT and AI in education proves that assignments are viewed as mundane and unimportant to a student’s learning.

(Some may argue that) integrating project-based learning and independent studies into the existing curriculum poses significant logistical complexities, such as the need for specialized faculty expertise. However, many universities are often the greatest talent density in many fields compared to anywhere else. Additionally, schools could form strategic partnerships with industry, which would be beneficial for both the school, the industry, and the student.

(Granted), some subjects, particularly mathematics, naturally align with traditional learning methodologies due to the crucial need for a solid understanding of foundational principles. (However), encouraging students to apply concepts within their areas of interest can significantly deepen their grasp of why these subjects are essential. This rationale strengthens the case for supplementing traditional educational approaches with project-based learning.

# Rethinking Higher Education: Why Student Passion Projects Matter More Than Ever

As my first year at the University of Pennsylvania comes to a close, I find myself drawn towards what Mark Twain once [said](https://marktwainstudies.com/the-apocryphal-twain-i-have-never-let-schooling-interfere-with-my-education/): "I'll never let my schooling get in the way of my education." In agreement, I have found that the traditional university curriculum - rigid, grade-focused, and lecture-based - to be ineffective for students growing up in the era of artificial intelligence.

One reason is because traditional rigid course structures often fail to align with students' genuine interests and career aspirations, forcing them to slog through irrelevant general requirements. Countless students nationwide dread their Gen Eds, lamenting how "chemistry lectures are completely useless for learning computer science" in one example. The rigidity of this one-size-fits-all approach dampens enthusiasm for learning. And now, as we enter Into an era of easily accessible and abundant information provided by AI models that rival the knowledge of professors, textbook memorization as a method for education seems archaic.

Students need to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and those cannot be found in a textbook and memorizing formulas, but by doing. That means enabling students to pursue independent projects that *actually* counts towards their graduation requirements rather than treating it as a student side-project.

Traditional lecture-based learning also [often falls short](https://www.edge.co.uk/news-and-events/blogs/does-education-prepare-students-for-the-real-world/) in preparing students for real-world career experiences (which is embarrassing as the main point of an college education is to prepare students for a career). 

For example, last week I was invited to a dinner with Contrary Venture Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm. We discussed about the effectiveness of Penn's Entrepreneurship classes and came to a single conclusion: working on 10 page "business canvas" worksheets simply does not prepare students for what entrepreneurship truly is.

As a student pursuing entrepreneurship through an independent project (running my own startup), I find that I am learning far beyond what traditional lectures coursework could possibly offer. Could a couple of case-studies reviewed from class teach me how to apply oscilloscope measurements to software specific to my company? Could it teach me the design process or the manufacturing process for silicon chips?

Probably not.

Even the experience of pitching to hundreds of investors and raising millions in funding is something fundamental to entrepreneurship, but is rarely taught. Sure, one could learn the *theoretical* best way to pitch, but one must pitch to know how to pitch.

By diving head-first into running my startup, I have acquired a diverse, real-world applicable skill set and soft skills that can't be taught through 10 page worksheets: what it feels to "[move fast and break things](https://www.amazon.com/Move-Fast-Break-Things-Undermined/dp/0316275778)," working out cofounder disagreements, or dealing with the stress that inevitably comes when you're weeks away from running out of cash.

Furthermore, by allowing students to pursue their own interests, students will take a personal initiative to dive deep and learn, ultimately [leading to a better education](https://restart-reinvent.learningpolicyinstitute.org/emphasize-authentic-culturally-responsive-learning). From my own experiences, I found AP Biology uninteresting and did minimal work to scrape by. But that didn't mean I wasn't interested in biology as a whole - after all, I pursued six years of independent biology research at Stanford and Penn Medicine. Because my high school offered class credit for independent research, I was able to immerse myself in my research, gaining an extremely in-depth knowledge beyond a typical AP Biology course, and my intrinsic interest led to countless hours of dedicated effort outside the classroom.

Finally, a traditional university education focuses way too heavily on grading. What is broken with education is because it selects for GPA prestige and degree status over education and learning. With the rise of AI, I suspect more students are and will use these technologies as a way to slog past their Gen Eds without regard to learning - all in the effort for the 4.0 GPA. In fact, I argue that the rise of GPT in [education](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/4162766-ai-cheating-has-hopelessly-irreparably-corrupted-us-higher-education/) (and [academia](https://www.research.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/We%27re%20All%20Using%20It.pdf) as well!) proves that these assignments are viewed as unimportant to a student's learning.

Some may argue that integrating project-based learning and independent studies into the existing curriculum poses significant [logistical complexities](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/practical-strategies-overcoming-challenges-interdisciplinary-projectbased-learning), such as the need for specialized faculty expertise. However, many universities are often the greatest talent density in many fields compared to anywhere else. Additionally, schools could form strategic partnerships with industry, which would be beneficial for the school, the industry, and the student.

Granted, some subjects, such as mathematics, naturally align with traditional learning methodologies due to the crucial need for a solid understanding of foundational principles. However, encouraging students to apply concepts within their areas of interest can significantly deepen their grasp of why these subjects are essential. This rationale strengthens the case for supplementing traditional educational approaches with project-based learning. Moreover, independent studies should not be mandatory for all students. There should be a sufficient barrier in place to ensure that only motivated learners with the necessary problem-solving abilities pursue this path.

**Well-resourced universities should put a greater emphasis on opportunities that allow students to pursue independent project based learning.** Universities like [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/scdc/co-op/undergraduate) and [Northeastern](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/undergraduate-co-op/) have already recognized the value of real-world experience, offering acclaimed co-op programs that allow students to receive class credit while gaining professional exposure.
