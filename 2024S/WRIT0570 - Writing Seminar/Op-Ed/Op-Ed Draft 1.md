# Rhetorical Situation
Proposition: University educators should provide greater opportunities for students to pursue passion projects for self-learning.

Audience: Most likely university staff, including professors, educators, academic advisors, etc. They are most likely interested in helping students learn better, reforming the education system. University students interested in pursuing “better” forms of education for themselves, such as projects or gap year internships may also read.

Genre: An online 600 word editorial in a popular education-based publication targeted towards university staff and students thinking about education reform.

Motive of Author: As someone who wishes to go into engineering and entrepreneurship, both of which are widely regarded as very hands on and cannot be taught in a traditional school-based environment, I wish that Penn and other schools offered their students a greater degree of independent studies and projects that could still fulfill their academic credit limits. As a student myself, I recognize that most students see assignments and the current education system as “broken” and thus aim to game the system and view assignments as grade-focused only instead of learning opportunities. My motive is thus to convince students to pursue independent studies if possible, and for university faculty and administrators to consider a greater degree of supporting independent studies from students. My other motive is to write a compelling editorial that could get me published and all the benefits that come from that.

Motive of Reader: The reader is frustrated with the current educational system, whether they are staff or students, and want to seek ways to either help their students learn better or want to find other opportunities to learn (especially in a hands-on real-world environment). Such readers will be intrigued in my personal experiences with starting a passion project, and from an engineering/entrepreneurship POV, I believe I offer some unique perspectives on this idea.

Author’s Goal: To convince the reader that they should pursue passion projects or co-ops or gap year internships (students) or that expanding an independent study program or starting a co-op program is highly beneficial for students (educators), and that the current classroom based learning style is outdated.

Author’s Plan: To show the reader several anecdotal examples of learning a lot from passion projects, stats on what industries say about college students (they are ill-prepared) and stats about hiring rates after graduating college, references to other universities co-op or independent study programs.

Rhetorical Strategies: Anecdotes + stats. Emotional + rational appeal!

# Logical Outline
(Given) A university/college role is to help students learn.
(Given) Educators want to help their students learn the best they can.
(Given) Traditional education has a focus on grading, assignments, and rigid course structure that does not allow for the student to be flexible and take interesting courses.
(Given) A student within a university wants to graduate in 4 years and thus make the most of their time at university to learn and prepare for their future.
(Given) A major role of university is to prepare students for a future career.

(Thus) University staff, educators, and administrators should allow students to pursue project based, independent studies as a core of their course curriculum.

(Because) Traditional education contains rigid course selections that may not be in a student’s interest.
(For example) Many students complain about General Requirements that are not related to what they want to pursue.

(Because) Many traditional courses do not reflect the experiences in a real-world career environment.
(For example) Learning “entrepreneurship” by studying previous case-studies does not teach students to actually launch and run a business and the processes involved in it.

(Because) Students interested in their passion projects will rapidly learn more and provide a better learning experience reflective of a real-world career.
(For example) Personal anecdote of doing research and understanding biology versus a biology class.

(Because) University focuses too much on grading, leading to students achieving the highest grade rather than truly learning.
(For example) The rise of GPT and AI in education proves that assignments are viewed as mundane and unimportant to a student’s learning.

(Some may argue that) integrating project-based learning and independent studies into the existing curriculum poses significant logistical complexities, such as the need for specialized faculty expertise. However, many universities are often the greatest talent density in many fields compared to anywhere else. Additionally, schools could form strategic partnerships with industry, which would be beneficial for both the school, the industry, and the student.

(Granted), some subjects, particularly mathematics, naturally align with traditional learning methodologies due to the crucial need for a solid understanding of foundational principles. (However), encouraging students to apply concepts within their areas of interest can significantly deepen their grasp of why these subjects are essential. This rationale strengthens the case for supplementing traditional educational approaches with project-based learning.

# Rethinking Higher Education: Why Student Passion Projects Matter More Than Ever

As a student entrepreneur and researcher, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of passion projects and independent studies in higher education. Traditional classroom-based learning, while essential, often falls short in preparing students for the dynamic challenges of real-world careers. It is time for universities, particularly well-resourced institutions like the Ivy League, to embrace a more holistic approach to education by providing greater opportunities for students to pursue self-directed learning. As Mark Twain famously quipped, "I never let my schooling get in the way of my education."

The current educational system's rigid course structures and emphasis on grading often fail to align with students' genuine interests and career aspirations. Many students find themselves slogging through general requirements that bear little relevance to their intended paths. This one-size-fits-all approach not only dampens enthusiasm for learning but also leaves students ill-equipped to tackle real-world challenges. In the words of anthropologist Margaret Mead, "Children must be taught how to think, not what to think."

In contrast, passion projects and independent studies allow students to delve deep into their areas of interest, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and practical skills. My own experiences speak volumes about the value of such opportunities. In high school, I conducted six years of independent biology and neuroscience research at Stanford and Penn Medicine. The class credit I received enabled me to immerse myself in the subject matter, gaining invaluable real-world experience that transcended mere grades. The intrinsic motivation fueled by my passion led to countless hours of dedicated effort outside the classroom.

Now, as a college student running my startup, Nanoneuro Systems, I am learning far beyond what traditional coursework can offer. From electrical engineering and bioengineering to public speaking and entrepreneurship, I am acquiring a diverse skill set that will serve me well in my future endeavors. As the saying goes, "Textbooks = learning via memorization. Project-based = learning via critical thinking, problem solving, and doing." In an era where information is at our fingertips, textbooks alone seem archaic. Students need to develop soft skills, and those cannot be found in a textbook.

Renowned universities like Drexel and Northeastern have already recognized the value of real-world experience, offering acclaimed co-op programs that allow students to receive class credit while gaining professional exposure. It is time for Ivy League universities, with their vast resources and influential alumni networks, to follow suit and support personalized, project-based learning.

Critics may argue that project-based learning is not suitable for all subjects, particularly mathematics, where a strong foundation is crucial for STEM careers. They contend that relying solely on project-based learning in K-12 education may leave students underprepared for college-level mathematics. While this concern is valid, it should not deter universities from offering independent study opportunities. Instead, a balanced approach that combines traditional learning methods with project-based experiences can deepen students' understanding of the practical applications of these subjects.

Moreover, independent studies should not be mandatory for all students. There should be a sufficient barrier in place to ensure that only motivated learners with the necessary literacy skills and problem-solving abilities pursue this path. By setting appropriate criteria, universities can maintain the integrity of these programs and prevent students from simply going through the motions.

In conclusion, it is time for Ivy League universities to embrace the power of passion projects and independent studies. By providing students with the freedom to explore their interests and apply their knowledge in real-world contexts, we can cultivate a generation of critical thinkers, problem-solvers, and innovators. Let us empower students to take charge of their education and prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead.
