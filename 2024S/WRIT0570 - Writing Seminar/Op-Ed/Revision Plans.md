# Draft 1 Plans
I think a lot of suggestions revolved around fitting my prop earlier in the argument and adjusting it to be shorter and more concise, which is what I want to do. Now, it should be more clear what I am trying to argue for.

A lot of people have said that my anecdotal evidence was very compelling (something that is working well); however they wanted to see more numbers based evidence. For my next revision, I would include my statistics, but I don't want to overdo it because it should be an op-ed with my voice and opinions, and I would want to keep it that way.

My presentation seems to be pretty good - it was engaging, interesting, and had nice paragraph lengths. I will keep it that way for the next revision.

For my future revisions, based on some feedback, I would remove some of my anecdotes that are less related with what I am arguing for (such as the AP Bio example), and I would remove AI from the proposition since that confuses the readers and make it more complex than necessary.

# Draft 2 Plans
Regarding my prop, my reviewers agree that the prop is well setup with the context and premises.

However, my target reader and audience were not as well established. For my next revision, I would explicitly mention my audiences and who I am targeting. That would be university administrators specifically.

My paragraphs also got slightly longer, so I will need to split them up or remove them to keep my op-ed shorter.

The anecdotes continue to be doing well, people find it engaging and gives my op-ed a unique voice rather than a bunch of statistics. This is something I will continue to do.

Finally, there is a general consensus to expand on my conclusion and counterarguments, which is what I will do for my next draft. I will add more about what Drexel and Northeastern is already doing with their co-op programs, and end with a call to action on how elite universities need to be following suit.
