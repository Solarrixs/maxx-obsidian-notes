Dear Faculty Readers:

I'm studying Materials Science and Engineering (1 of 16 for the class of 2027!) with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering Entrepreneurship. I would say that I'm a very avid reader, attempting to read at least 2 hours a day - primarily through newsletters, books, and journal articles for my research. I enjoy writing both creative works and long analytical works, especially on new technologies or companies working on an interesting problems. In my free time, I enjoy reefing and playing badminton!

I didn't find the MicroRhetoric and Private Sectors modules to be particularly challenging, but I would say that the most challenging aspect was grasping the nuances of the communication forms used to persuade an employer to hire you. I did find the MicroRhetoric and Private Sectors modules to be one of my favorite modules though. I found the MR module to be super interesting, because I have never even considered that, and was a personally relevant course material to me. The Private Sector module was also extremely practically useful, as I'm sure my peers and I all have to apply to jobs and internships in the near future. Learning to refine my resume and cover letter was not only practical but enjoyable as I understand directly how it could be applied to my future.

This challenge connected to my prior knowledge of rhetorical devices and persuasive writing techniques acquired in previous English classes. However, the MicroRhetoric and Private Sector modules delved deeper into the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios. While I was able to build upon my existing knowledge, this challenge required me to think more critically about the intentions behind the use of specific language, especially in the resume and cover letters. To meet this challenge, I relied on what I learned in class to revise my resume and cover-letter (for example, adding a proper and standard header, structuring the cover letter specifically to appeal to what a job recruiter might be looking for, etc), which I found to be beneficial in ingraining that knowledge from lecture into real-world applications (this topic is coincidentally my op-ed topic!)

Through this challenge, I learned that I was actually very interested in the psychology behind persuasive communication and how it shapes our perceptions and decisions - for example, on AAVE and how that affected the court trial as we saw in the video shown in class. In terms of writing, I have gained a greater appreciation for the importance of considering the audience's perspective when crafting an argument or message (particularly in the resume and cover letter). This challenge has taught me to be more mindful of the persuasive techniques I encounter in my daily life and professional life. Moving forward, I plan to consistently apply this knowledge to my future writing, especially during job or internship searches, ensuring that I am using these techniques to effectively communicate my ideas.

Sincerely,
Maxx Yung
