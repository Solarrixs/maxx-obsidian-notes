# Introduction
Given that McKinsey is an influential consulting firm who aims to advise companies to increase profitability.

Thus McKinsey's advice can instead have detrimental effects on employees and the company.

Because McKinsey often recommends drastic cost-cutting measures which can compromise employee safety and lead to accidents.

Because McKinsey's advice can cause companies to value short-term financial gains at the expense of overall long-term gains.

# Chapter 1
Given that McKinsey is an influential consulting firm who emphasize their moral and ethical values to attract business.

Thus McKinsey prioritizes client interests and profits over everything else (such as their moral and social values).
	
Because McKinsey is willing to work with controversial industries or governments despite ethical dilemmas or questionable social impact.

Because McKinsey's culture nudges their consultants to accept almost all consulting cases despite moral choices or face pressure to leave the firm.

# Chapter 2
Given that outsourcing and restructuring jobs depresses wages and lower job security.

Thus McKinsey's consulting practices have played a key role in exacerbating wealth inequality.

Because McKinsey nudges corporate executives to inflate their salaries.

Because McKinsey nudges companies to cut costs by outsourcing and restructuring instead of improving revenue.

# Chapter 3
Given that McKinsey can work with both private companies and public governments.

Thus McKinsey’s involvement in the healthcare industry poses a clear conflict of interest.

Because its advantageous connections with the government helps it secure contracts that other firms can’t.

For example, when Illinois was trying to evaluate and overhaul Medicaid, McKinsey was able to obtain non-bidding contracts at a higher cost due to policies being bent in their favor.

Because its connections with the government helps its clients bypass regulations.

For example, McKinsey was able to get the FDA’s approval of Biogen’s Aduhelm drug, despite clear evidence that it wasn’t effective.

# Chapter 4
Given that McKinsey’s consulting with ICE presents clear violations of its Values.

Thus McKinsey faces backlash for their work.

Because the firm’s business practices conflict with ethical standards.

For example, McKinsey consultants spoke out against its work with ICE, only to be replied with “We don’t do policy, we do execution.”

Because McKinsey violates human rights to save on costs.

For example, McKinsey advised ICE to cut spending on food for detainees, a recommendation the ICE workers were even against.

# Chapter 6
Given that Mckinsey has a long history of be extremely secretive about the recommendations it provides its clients

Thus McKinsey’s secrecy has allowed it to help tobacco companies create toxic products without penalty while making a fortune doing so. 

Because two former senior officials of the FDA’s Office of Policy for the Center of Tobacco Products discovered McKinsey’s long record of simultaneously consulting for cigarette companies and the FDA.

For example, the details of McKinsey’s work for Big Tobacco has been buried deep in industry documents and when questioned about its role in Philip Morris’s business, it stressed that the consultants were not aware of it. 

Because McKinsey and its clients had a mutual agreement as cigarette companies did not want consultants sharing marketing strategy, and McKinsey did not want its reputation tainted as an enabler of companies that sold deadly products. 

For example, among the list of McKinsey recommendations for Big Tobacco, many of the reports were marked “highly confidential” that included recommendations for how the research department should structure its experimental pilot plant.
