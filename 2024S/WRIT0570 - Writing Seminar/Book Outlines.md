# Chapter 1
Given that McKinsey is an influential consulting firm who emphasize their moral and ethical values to attract business.

Given that examples of McKinsey's values include observing high ethical standards, safety, and environmental protection.

Thus McKinsey prioritizes client interests and profits over everything else (such as their moral and social values).

What McKinsey is willing to work with controversial industries or governments despite ethical dilemmas or questionable social impact.

Thus McKinsey's consulting practices have played a key role in exacerbating wealth inequality.

What McKinsey nudges corporate executives to inflate their salaries.

What McKinsey nudges companies to cut costs by outsourcing and restructuring instead of improving revenue.

# Chapter 3
Given that McKinsey can work with both private companies and public governments.

Thus McKinsey’s involvement in the healthcare industry poses a clear conflict of interest.

What its advantageous connections with the government helps it secure contracts that other firms can’t.

For example, when Illinois was trying to evaluate and overhaul Medicaid, McKinsey was able to obtain non-bidding contracts at a higher cost due to policies being bent in their favor.

What its connections with the government helps its clients bypass regulations.

For example, McKinsey was able to get the FDA’s approval of Biogen’s Aduhelm drug, despite clear evidence that it wasn’t effective.

# Chapter 4 ❌
Given that McKinsey’s consulting with ICE presents clear violations of its Values.

Thus McKinsey faces backlash and criticisms from the public for their work on ICE ❌

What the firm’s business practices conflict with ethical standards.

For example, McKinsey consultants spoke out against its work with ICE, only to be replied with “We don’t do policy, we do execution.”

What McKinsey violates human rights to save on costs.

For example, McKinsey advised ICE to cut spending on food for detainees, a recommendation the ICE workers were even against.

# Chapter 6
Given that McKinsey has a long history of be extremely secretive about the recommendations it provides its clients.

Given that tobacco companies attempt to hide the fact that cigarettes and tobacco is dangerous for public health and safety in order to earn more revenue.

Thus McKinsey’s secrecy has allowed it to help tobacco companies create toxic products without penalty while making a fortune doing so.

How McKinsey maintained a dual consultancy role, advising both cigarette companies and the FDA to influence the tobacco industry regulations subtly to help the interests of their tobacco clients.

For example, McKinsey’s consultancy with Big Tobacco was deeply buried in industry documents, demonstrating its desire to remain secretive in their involvement with tobacco company as they consulted for the FDA.

What McKinsey and its clients agreed to keep marketing strategies confidential, preventing damage to McKinsey's reputation as an enabler of harmful products.

For example, among the list of McKinsey recommendations for Big Tobacco, many of the reports were marked “highly confidential” that included recommendations for how the research department should structure its experimental pilot plant.

# Chapter 7

Given McKinsey's extensive expertise in the pharmaceutical sector.

Thus McKinsey's engagement in the pharma industry has exacerbated the opioid epidemic.

What McKinsey advised pharmaceutical firms to focus their marketing efforts on individuals more susceptible to opioid addiction.

For example, McKinsey recommended that Johnson & Johnson concentrate their marketing efforts on patients at greater risk of abuse.

What McKinsey employed false marketing strategies to boost sales of opioids.

For example, McKinsey instructed Purdue Pharma to market their opioid specifically as Oxycontin because it was viewed as positive.

# Chapter 8

Given McKinsey claims to have a public commitment to sustainability and climate action.

Thus McKinsey’s consulting practices for major polluting companies is in contrast to their values of environmental protection.

 What McKinsey's continued profitable engagements with the fossil fuel industry and major polluters.

 For example, McKinsey has counted at least seventeen mining and fossil fuel companies among its biggest clients, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.

 For example, McKinsey has advised at least 43 of the hundred companies responsible for the most carbon emissions since 1965, indicating a significant portion of its business is with industries contributing to global warming.

 What McKinsey's influence on clients' decisions that do not prioritize sustainability efforts.

For example, McKinsey is involved in projects like "Coal Processing Optimization" and advises on the expansion of coal production.

For example, McKinsey still advises major steel and oil companies and defend their work with them.

For example, the firm has not committed to disclosing the total carbon emissions of its clients or refusing projects that would increase carbon emissions.

# Chapter 9

Given the proliferation of securitization in financial markets exacerbated the financial crisis of 2008,

Thus McKinsey played a pivotal role in forming financial practices that precipitated the global financial crisis.

What McKinsey is known to encourage risk-taking and discourage regulatory oversight in the financial sector.

For example, McKinsey's advice on restructuring to institutions like Continental Illinois promoted decentralization, leading to more hazardous lending behaviors and significant failures within the banking industry.

What McKinsey's contribution to advising banks led to widespread economic instability and ultimately the 2008 financial crisis.

For example, the Securitization Project by Lowell Bryan at McKinsey, which sought to revolutionize banking through securitization, was heavily marketed as a positive financial innovation.

For example, through its publications and advisory services worldwide, McKinsey actively endorsed securitization, persuading banks and financial entities to embrace these methods broadly, neglecting the potential dangers involved.

What McKinsey advised banks to adopt their positive strategies but avoided discussing about its potential downsides.

For example, McKinsey persisted in its support for securitization despite mounting evidence of its role in inflating the housing bubble and the ensuing crisis.

For example, in the aftermath of the financial debacle, McKinsey and its advisors primarily shifted blame, pointing to regulatory oversights as the root cause of the catastrophe.

# Chapter 10

Given McKinsey is willing to prioritize profits at any cost.

Thus McKinsey guided Allstate towards several tactics to reduce payout compensation to policyholders.

What McKinsey encourages Allstate to quickly adopt strategies to minimize payouts.

For example, McKinsey's suggested Allstate expedite and economically resolve 90% of claims, while vigorously contesting the remaining 10%, especially those with legal representation, to decrease disbursements.

For example, McKinsey proposed that Allstate apply a "boxing gloves" approach to policyholders or claimants resisting initial low offers, leading to extended and expensive legal confrontations for the claimants.

What McKinsey strategies primarily benefitted top executives at Allstate and neglected policyholders.

What McKinsey advises Allstate to use the judicial system to avoid responsibility.
