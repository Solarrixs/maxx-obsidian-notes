I don't think any of the modules were that challenging but the Logic modules was confusing. I think it is hard to determine what is a premise (or whether a premise  could be 2 premises, or could be reason, etc) and whether our proposition is actually a reason or an example and so on. It was confusing because I have not done this type of analysis before, and that there wasn't a defined reason for why something could be a premise, a proposition, reason, or example.

This confusion partly stems from how I never did this kind of analysis on articles in the past (besides identifying the thesis). This skill did expand upon my prior knowledge of identifying a thesis but now how the author backs up their points and what facts they inherently assume about the reader. Overall, I learned a new skill that built on top of a somewhat related knowledge I did earlier, and learned how to search and think about what an author assumes about their readers and whether their reasons for their thesis are logically coherent.

Something I learned from the challenge was that in all forms of communication, whether that be public communication, debating, telling a story, or writing an article, writing an essay and so on, we all assume general premises about our audience, which was something I never considered. I learned that I never had articulated my premises explicitly before, and now I realize the importance of agreeing on the same premises before moving onto the main argument/topic/thesis. I think this is something new in writing that is very important and I will use for the rest of my writing career.
