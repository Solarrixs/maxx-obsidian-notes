In _When McKinsey Comes to Town (2022)_, Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe unveils the hidden influence of McKinsey across industries and governments. Through accessible case studies for the general public, the authors investigated McKinsey's omnipresence in sectors like oil, pharmaceuticals, and government. Yet, throughout all sectors, McKinsey's expert management consulting advice leads to three main strategies to satisfy corporate interests: product strategy, cost-cutting, or layoffs. Disturbingly, McKinsey's advice often prioritizes these three strategies regardless of the consequences, such as compromising worker safety in U.S. Steel and Disneyland incidents, endangering lives through extreme cost measures in immigrant facilitates, or ignoring their firm's values of ethics and global positive change in their work with oil majors and the governments of China and Saudi Arabia. This pattern, as revealed by the authors, underscores a stark contrast between McKinsey's public image and their work, which have tangible adverse effects on the public.
