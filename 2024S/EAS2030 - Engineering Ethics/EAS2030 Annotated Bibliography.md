# Article 1
[Tech firms are making computer chips with human cells – is it ethical?](https://theconversation.com/tech-firms-are-making-computer-chips-with-human-cells-is-it-ethical-183394)

Gyngell, Christopher, et al. “Tech Firms Are Making Computer Chips with Human Cells – Is It Ethical?” The Conversation, theconversation.com/tech-firms-are-making-computer-chips-with-human-cells-is-it-ethical-183394.

There are 3 authors to this source. Julian Savulescu is a professor in biomedical ethics and is a professor in law at the University of Melbourne, and is the Uehiro Chair in Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford. He also consults for Bayer Bioethics Committee. Christopher Gyngell is a research fellow in biomedical ethics at the University of Melbourne. Tsutomu Sawai is a professor in social sciences at Hiroshima University and is part of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology at Kyoto University. These are people involved with law and ethics and concerned about the intersection of ethics and biotech.

The context for why this source was created was following the invention of synthetic biological intelligence through a biological-based computer by Cortical Labs. Since it was the first time human biology was ever used to function as a computer, it sparked new grounds for ethical concerns. These authors got together to discuss this very very new type of computing.

In general, they summarize that biologics computing is a larger trend towards better computing than silicon computers. They describe how silicon computing is much slower. The ethical question the authors pose is whether people who provide tissue samples for tech research know it is being used to build computers? The authors believe that biologics based computing will have ethical concerns with donation issues as it touches on the themes of exploitation - because it is unclear whether using the biological neurons of people like Einstein will create better biologics based computing? This problem is similar to Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) cells. I agree with the authors that biologics based computing will have a moral and ethical consideration that we will need to bypass. This article provides relevant examples that I would use to inform my ethics discussion - however, they didn't provide any sort of reasons for what they believe could solve these ethical and moral concerns.

[DishBrain: Bio-Computing's Rise and Ethics in the Age of Living Machines - Neuroscience News](https://neurosciencenews.com/biocomputing-ethics-dishbrain-23941/)

News, Neuroscience. “DishBrain: Bio-Computing’s Rise and Ethics in the Age of Living Machines.” _Neuroscience News_, 19 Sept. 2023, neurosciencenews.com/biocomputing-ethics-dishbrain-23941/.

The source comes from Neuroscience News, which is a major publisher of neuroscience research. They publish news on the cutting edge of neuroscience. The context for this source is the invention of the DishBrain, a biologics based computing platform that was developed for the first time ever just 2 years ago. The source, like previous sources, open the question whether this is even moral, as we don't have a fully defined definition of consciousness, nor can we tell if the neurons we used to train the computers can be conscious and feel reward and pain signals. Furthermore, another ethical issue that this article brings about is since the DIshBrain is being used in healthcare context, can the predominantly European type genetic ancestry of the cells lead to differing results in a more diverse context? It resonates with the previous Article 1 as it poses similar ethical concerns as the other Article and describes how this super new field in computing might lead to very new ethical and moral concerns.

# Article 3
[Bio-computing: Should a brain in a dish have moral rights? • Earth.com](https://www.earth.com/news/bio-computing-should-a-brain-in-a-dish-have-moral-rights/)

“Bio-Computing: Should a Brain in a Dish Have Moral Rights?” _Earth.com_, www.earth.com/news/bio-computing-should-a-brain-in-a-dish-have-moral-rights/.

This source centers around experts in the field of biocomputing, with Dr. Brett Kagan leading the Cortical Lab team who created the DishBrain. Professors Julian Savulescu and Tamra Lysaght, along with Dr. Christopher Gyngell, contribute their expertise from ethical, philosophical, and medical research perspectives.

This articles, like the previous articles I analyzed, emerges in response to the development of the DishBrain by Cortical Labs, which used live neurons for computing purposes. The project fuses of biologics with traditional silicon, and thus the authors raise questions about intelligence, consciousness, and ethics in this type of technology. One major limiting factor of why this article came about is because of our limited understanding of consciousness and moral rights.

I think that the source presents a nuanced argument that while bio-computing offers revolutionary possibilities in medicine and environmental sustainability, it simultaneously poses challenging ethical dilemmas. It debates the moral status of biologically based intelligent systems, and uses Jeremy Bentham's views on consciousness and suffering to discuss whether using neurons are morally justified. For example, there are expressed concerns about whether current ethical frameworks can address the complexities introduced by bio-computing technologies. However, like the other articles as well, the paper does not provide definitive answers to these ethical dilemmas.

Comparing this source with my prior articles I analyzed, it also says that technological advancements often outpace the development of ethical guidelines. It also emphasizes the importance of integrating ethical considerations into the innovation process.

# Article 4
[Ethical challenges posed by biological neuronal networks | Blog | Think Theology](https://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/tthical_challenges_posed_by_biological_neuronal_networks)

“Ethical Challenges Posed by Biological Neuronal Networks.” _What You Think Matters_, 11 Mar. 2024, thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/tthical_challenges_posed_by_biological_neuronal_networks.

This article is written under Think Theology, a platform that delves into theological discussions and ethical considerations from a Christian perspective.

This article originates from a concern over the rapid advancements in BNN technology to create synthetic biological intelligence by integrating human brains into computing systems. Like the previous articles, the ethical implications are usually over these factors: the source of neurons, the potential consciousness of BNNs and whether we are making them suffer, donor consent and income for the donors, and uniquely, the implications of this technology on perceptions of human intelligence and the soul from a Christian perspective. Based on biblical teachings, they claim that the intrinsic value of human life is being created in the image of God, and thus challenges the commodification of human parts and the ethical dilemmas posed by synthetic intelligence.

This article was unique as it talked about engineering ethics by integrating religious insights with ethical considerations (showing the importance of diverse perspectives in innovation). However, I disagree that religious context needs to be taken into heavy account in scientific terms and innovation. A recent example to support my beliefs is how they denied COVID19 vaccines, which led to the loss of millions of lives. So I believe while they bring a unique point to the ethics discussions of BNNs and synthetic intelligence, their concerns of religious ethics in this technology are not important to consider, as they have no real inherent basis.

# Article 5
[Inventor ponders ethics of wiring human brain tissue into computers](https://newatlas.com/computers/cortical-labs-dishbrain-ethics/)
“Inventor Ponders Ethics of Wiring Human Brain Tissue into Computers.” _New Atlas_, 22 Sept. 2023, newatlas.com/computers/cortical-labs-dishbrain-ethics/.

The source is an interview with the creator of Cortical Labs, the company that all the other articles I have analyzed talked about. They have developed a Synthetic Biological Intelligence with the University of Melbourne.

The purpose behind this source and interview being done is the need to explore and even more so, articulate and define the ethical, philosophical, and technical implications of merging biological life with computational technology. Cortical Labs' work in developing the DishBrain system raises many fundamental questions about the nature of life, intelligence, and consciousness, that we currently have no answers to.

According to the interview and the creator of Cortical Labs, he discuss the concept of criticality as a characteristic of complex systems by showing how biological systems can exhibit behaviors indicative of intelligence without necessarily implying consciousness, and used an example of GPT passing the Turing test, yet is not sentient either. I agree with the cautious approach the creators of Cortical Labs are taking towards the ethical implications of their work. Their emphasis on the need for a clear and common language to discuss these emerging technologies is crucial for forming a coherent ethical framework. I also like how he is collaborating with ethical leaders in this space to rapidly come up with ethical guidelines in this space. However, a notable weakness is simply how new this technology is, and therefore inherent speculative nature of its ethical discussions.

I think this interview was very informative in engineering ethics as it provides a prime example of how new technologies can blur the ethical boundaries. It also underscores the importance of collaboration in navigating the ethical dimensions of technological innovation.
