Instructions  
- Select 5 of your sources. Each source should be from a different kind of stakeholder. Under each citation, write 8-10 sentences in which you:  
1. Discuss the author or creator of the source. For an individual, provide identifying information such as title, institutional affiliation, and industry. For organizations, provide context if it is an engineering firm, regulator, or other stakeholder.  
2. Give context for how and why this source was created.  
3. Analyze the source. If it’s making an argument, summarize the argument and  express if you agree and why or why not. What are its strengths and weaknesses? How does it resonate with or contradict your other source materials? What have you learned that will inform your analysis of the engineering ethics topic?

# Article 1
[Tech firms are making computer chips with human cells – is it ethical?](https://theconversation.com/tech-firms-are-making-computer-chips-with-human-cells-is-it-ethical-183394)

Gyngell, Christopher, et al. “Tech Firms Are Making Computer Chips with Human Cells – Is It Ethical?” The Conversation, theconversation.com/tech-firms-are-making-computer-chips-with-human-cells-is-it-ethical-183394.

There are 3 authors to this source. Julian Savulescu is a professor in biomedical ethics and is a professor in law at the University of Melbourne, and is the Uehiro Chair in Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford. He also consults for Bayer Bioethics Committee. Christopher Gyngell is a research fellow in biomedical ethics at the University of Melbourne. Tsutomu Sawai is a professor in social sciences at Hiroshima University and is part of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology at Kyoto University.

The context for why this source was created was following the invention of synthetic biological intelligence through a biological-based computer by Cortical Labs. Since it was the first time human biology was ever used to function as a computer, it sparked new grounds for ethical concerns. These authors got together to discuss this very very new type of computing.

In general, they summarize that biologics computing is a larger trend towards better computing than silicon computers. They describe how silicon computing is much slower. The ethical question the authors pose is whether people who provide tissue samples for tech research know it is being used to build computers? The authors believe that biologics based computing will have ethical concerns with donation issues as it touches on the themes of exploitation - because it is unclear whether using the biological neurons of people like Einstein will create better biologics based computing? This problem is similar to Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) cells. I agree with the authors that biologics based computing will have a moral and ethical consideration that we will need to bypass. This article provides relevant examples that I would use to inform my ethics discussion - however, they didn't provide any sort of reasons for what they believe could solve these ethical and moral concerns.
