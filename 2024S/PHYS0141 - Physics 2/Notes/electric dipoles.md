The net force on an electric dipole in a uniform external electric field is zero.

However, there could still be a torque force:
$\tau = (qE)(d\sin \phi) = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$
- $d\sin \phi$ is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the two forces
- $\vec{p}$ = electric dipole moment
- $\vec{E}$ = electric field
- $\tau$ is greatest when $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$ are perpendicular and is 0 when they are parallel

The electric dipole moment is:
$p=qd$
- product of charge $q$ and separation distance $d$

The potential energy of an electric dipole is:
$U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}$
- minimum (most negative) at the stable equilibrium position where $\phi = 0$ and $\vec{p} \parallel \vec{E}$ (so when $U=-pE$)
- maximum when $\phi = \pi$ and $\vec{p}$ is antiparallel to $\vec{E}$, where $U = pE$
