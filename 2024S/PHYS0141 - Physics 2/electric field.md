$$
E = \frac{F_{0}}{q_{0}} = \frac{N}{C}
$$
If $q_{0}$ is positive, the force $F_{0}$ experienced by the charge is in the same direction as $E$.
If $q_{0}$ is negative, the force $F_{0}$ experienced by the charge is in opposite direction as $E$.

- star This equation is only for point test charges only.

$$
E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$
The electric field of a point charge always points away from a positive charge (same direction as $\hat{r}$) but towards a negative charge.
