$$F = k\dfrac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^2} = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \dfrac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^2}$$

If $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ have the same sign, the forces are repulsive. If the charges are opposite signs, the forces are attractive.

$k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \dfrac{Nm^2}{C_{2}} = 9 \times 10^9 \dfrac{Nm^2}{C^2}$

$e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$

$\epsilon_{0} = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \dfrac{C^2}{Nm^2}$ is the electric constant.

Through the principle of superposition of forces, you can apply Coulomb's law to any two charges and adding the vector sum of the forces to get the total [[electric field]].
