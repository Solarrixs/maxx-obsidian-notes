Electric field lines is an imaginary line drawn so that its tangent at any point is in the direction of the electric field vector.

Shows the direction of $\hat{E}$ ([[electric field]]) at each point and gives an idea of the magnitude of $\hat{E}$ at each point.
- If $\hat{E}$ is strong, then the lines are drawn closer together
- At any point, the electric field has a unique direction, so only one field line exists at each point of the field. Field lines don't intersect
- Field lines always point away from positive charges and towards negative charges
