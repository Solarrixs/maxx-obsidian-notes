$MC = \dfrac{\Delta TC}{\Delta q} = \dfrac{\Delta VC}{\Delta q}$
- Change in total cost or variable cost over change in quantity of output
- Fixed costs does not affect marginal cost!
- Diminishing marginal returns causes increasing marginal costs

Given that wages are fixed, there is an inverse relationship between [[marginal product of labor]] and [[marginal cost]]
- This is because of $MC = \dfrac{W}{MP_{L}}$

This means that marginal cost is affected by variable costs but not by fixed costs.

Marginal costs intersect with [[average costs]].

Profit margin = $P - MC$
- This means a less steep [[demand curve]] (or a less [[price elasticity of demand]]), the lower the quantity produced and the price will increase above [[marginal cost]].
