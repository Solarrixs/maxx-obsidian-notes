Supply only occurs in a perfect competitive firm.
- Supply changes only with variable costs, not fixed costs

# Determinants of supply curve:
- Change in variable cost: increase VC = decrease supply = leftward shift of supply curve
- Change in productivity/technology: more efficient = decrease VC = increase supply
- Seller Expectation: if price is expected to increase in the future, then current supply decrease
- Number of sellers: higher firms = increase supply = flatter (elastic) supply at same y-int
