The [[marginal rate of substitution]] is the willingness of a person to give up good Y to get 1 more unit of good X. The more you have of good X, the more willing you are to give it up for a little bit of good Y.

$MRS_{xy} = \dfrac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}$
- Read as MRS of X for Y.
- The MRS is the slope on the [[indifference curve]] - $\dfrac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$
- $MU$ is [[marginal utility]]
