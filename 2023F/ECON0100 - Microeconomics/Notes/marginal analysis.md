Marginal analysis compares [[marginal revenue]] and [[marginal cost]] instead of using [[isoprofit curve|isoprofit curves]].

Producing more units of a good affects revenue in 2 ways:
1. Quantity effect: $q$ increases, increasing revenue
2. Price effect: As $q$ increases, $p$ (price) must lower due to downward sloping demand, reducing revenue

Therefore, quantity effect - price effect = change in total revenue, or the [[marginal revenue]].

- ex The MR for the following case: $100 and 20 units sold, then $99 and 21 units sold, is $78. This is calculated by $\frac{99 \times 21 - 100\times 20}{21-20}$

# Steps to Maximizing Profit
Because a firm's total revenue increases [[marginal revenue]] > [[marginal cost]], the firm reaches maximum [[profit]] when $MR=MC$ (where MR and MC curves intersect). This is the profit maximizing quantity.
- The equation of MR can be obtained from the equation of the demand curve

The firm can also increase price at that point to further maximize their profit. Once $MR=MC$ is determined, go above to the [[demand curve]] to find the corresponding price to sell at. This is the profit maximizing price.

After determining the profit maximizing quantity and price, the firm's profit can be determined. From $\pi = q \times (P-ATC)$, profit is the rectangle whose length is $q$ and width is $P-ATC$.

$ATC < P$ to be making a profit, otherwise $ATC > P$ means profit is negative. This is the same as saying $TR < TC$ and $TR > TC$. If $ATC = P$, then profits are 0.

> Pizza Plus operates in a monopolistically competitive industry and faces an inverse demand curve of _P_ = 30 â€“ 2_q_, where _q_ is measured in hundreds of pizzas per week and _P_ is the price per pizza. The marginal cost per pizza is $6. What price should Pizza Plus charge per pizza to maximize profit?

> > From the firm's demand curve we can write the marginal revenue (same y-intercept but twice the slope): MR=30-4q. The profit maximising quantity is such that MR=MC: 30-4q=6, so 4q=24 and q=6. Plugging the quantity into the firm's demand yields P=30-2q=30-12=18.
