The gain you get from buying something at a price below your willingness to pay, which is your [[demand curve|marginal benefit]].
- consumer surplus = [[demand curve|marginal benefit]] - price

Total consumer benefit is the integral of a [[demand curve]] at a certain price level. The  area underneath the triangle is the consumer's total expenditure (becomes the rectangle). The consumer surplus is the triangle above the consumer total expenditure.

Consumer surplus always increases with decreasing price.
