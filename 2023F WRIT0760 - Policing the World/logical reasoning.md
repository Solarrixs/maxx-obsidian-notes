# Introduction to Logical Reasoning
Logic and reasoning is the backbone of academic and professional writing.

## Formal Logic
Formal logic is mathematically based logic that requires little prose. Such as: $A>B \text{ and } B>C, \text{ therefore } A>C$.

But formal logic doesn't work when people will not be persuaded by symbols or by formal logic.

## Informal Logic
Informal logic is the way of being persuasive and using words to convey reasoning.

Critical writing and thinking assumes that people and readers are sane, rational, and open to multiple points of view and are capable of changing their minds by logical and ethical discourse. But with cognitive biases and logical fallacies, this is not true.

Thus, informal logical skills will help identify flaws in people's thinking and reasoning, and guide your thinking, writing, and speaking.

# Reasoning Structure

## Propositions, Reasons, and Evidences
A typical reasoning structure is a tree that starts with a main premise (facts or beliefs that readers generally accept), your proposition of a new idea you wish to prove or demonstrate, which then branches into multiple reasons with multiple evidences behind each reason.

Reasons are explanations that support the proposition while evidence are concrete data or studies that elaborate and ground the validity of the reasons.

Proposition and reason statements should be combined to form a coherent sentence. This tests for the validity and coherence of an argument.

**For example:**
Proposition: We should plant more trees
- Reason 1: Because trees help clean toxins from the air
- Reason 2: Because trees improve mental health

This forms a coherent sentence: We should plant more trees because trees help clean toxins from the air and trees improve mental health.

**An incorrect example of incoherent reasoning structure:**
Proposition: We should plant more trees in our cities
- Reason 1: The average percent of tree coverage is 27.1%

Although the reason is correct, there is no clear relationship between the proposition and reason.

Some tips for good logical structure:
- Clear and simple proposition so the readers know the focus of the argument
- Reasons are general statements that repeat the main phrase of the proposition
- Reasons directly connect to the proposition
- Ground and validate reasons with evidence.

## Constructing Meaningful Propositions
1. Identify operative terms and limit them as much as possible
2. Remove bifurcated propositions
3. Identify any implied relationships but unstated
4. Avoid needless words. Open with a subject and active verb
5. Identify if it is a justificatory or explanatory statement

## Premises
Premises are facts, beliefs, values, studies, or assumptions that you and your audience agrees on. A mutual shared ground.

Premises are usually established in the introduction.

In academic writing, premises include defining terms, citing previous studies, and highlighting study values.

A basic premise is that the reader approaches the text with an open mind and is willing to learn and change their views.

Finding the right premise in the introduction - whether to use facts, values, beliefs, or experiences - can setup a reader into a certain frame of mind to agree with your later proposition.

When reading someone else's argument, understand their premises and whether you agree with them. What is the writer taking for granted?
