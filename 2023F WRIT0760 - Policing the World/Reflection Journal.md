# Steps
Review the work you have done for the modules. What was the most challenging work and why? Consider declarative (what you needed to know), affective (emotionally), and procedural knowledge (planning and implementing) issues.

How did the challenges connect to what you already knew prior to this class or had already learned? Were you able to build upon that prior knowledge and how? How did this challenge differ from what you already knew how to do?

What do you think you learned from this challenge about yourself and writing?

Take notes on what looks new and familiar in the modules. Note whenever you find yourself in a situation you cannot address with your current level of skills.
