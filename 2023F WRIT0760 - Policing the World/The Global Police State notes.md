# Introduction
- ? What is Big Brother?

- ! "George Orwell got it wrong" means that it isn't totalitarian states that are bad, but actually democratic governments that cause problems.

The Core, Peripherals, and the Outliers reflect current society and the uneven distribution of wealth. Wealth is power, and power allows for political control.

- ? New technology might allow resources to be used to create a better political and economic system... how? Expanding social media presence to the surplus, open source designs, and 3D printing? Does that lessen the reliance on the wealthy for products?

- ? Automation is going to remove boring and demeaning work, but what will the displaced workers do if those jobs didn't exist?

Global capitalism is oppressive and an archaic system based on social relations. Replacing it with the newer tech can somehow meet the material and spiritual needs of humanity.
- I think this is something extremely hard to do simply because capitalism is so prevalent around the world, and most people in the West will have a positive view of this system anyways
- Is the author arguing that political, economic, and social circumstances are leading to the rise of socialism and fascism again?
- star I think the main proposition of the book is to propose the ultimate goal of replacing the current global capitalist system to avert disaster and be more beneficial and sustainable for the surplus humans by meeting their spiritual and material needs - both economic well-being and emotional satisfaction
- star Another purpose is to identify and explore capitalism and its new forms, and how it contributes to a global police state that interacts with the economic, political, ideological, and military dimensions with the goal of coercive exclusion of surplus humanity
- The new technology isn't being used to liberate humanity from capitalism but is being applied by agents of capitalism to bring about a global police state

A police state consists of:
- Police and military repression
- Authoritarian government
- Suppression of civil liberties and human rights

While this exists in many countries, this is emerging within the global economy and society (3 reasons):
1. Mass social control, repression, and warfare by ruling groups to contain the potential rebellion of the global working class (surplus humanity)
	- ex Border control, deportation regimes, mass incarceration, state and private surveillance, criminalization of the poor and working class through state-sanctioned repression that opens new profit-making opportunities for the "Core"
2. Global economy is based more on the development of systems of warfare, social control, and repression to make profit. Or "accumulation by repression".
	- ? What's an real life example of this?
	- ? So in areas of extreme global inequalities, it is maintained by social control and oppression?
	- & So essentially the US is encouraging wars and generating and sustaining social conflict (state sponsored violence) is on purpose to expand systems of warfare, repression, surveillance, and social control? War can make manufacturing companies produce more weapons and encourage more research and development into those areas. They can also profit from defense contracts, expand their markets, suppress dissent through drafts, or divert public attention?
	- & Perhaps in times of social or political unrest, there might be opportunities for powerful entities to take advantage of economic resources that were previously unavailable due to public resistance. Repression can allow them to maintain the status quo and continue exploiting resources for their own benefit.
3. Increasing move toward political systems than can be characterized as fascism or totalitarian.
	- Influence of neo-fascist, authoritarian movements such as Trumpism.
	- Neo-fascist culture is also emerging through militarism, misogyny, masculinization, and racism. This culture is prone to mass violence towards the racially and ethnically oppressed, women, poor, and other vulnerable communities.

In a simple sense, the global police state is a story of control and repression against poor and working classes - the surplus humans.
- ex Expressions of global police state: mass incarceration, police violence, US led wars, persecution of immigrants and refugees and other groups.
- ? How is the repression of environmental justice activists related with this topic?

# Chapter 1
Capitalism's values of maximizing profit and expanding outwardly drives colonialism and imperialism. This has remained for centuries.

But capitalism has changed continuously is the social formations and technologies which capitalism operates on, and the institutions and class relations that organize the system.

- star Right now, capitalism is becoming a global police state.

## First Stage of Capitalism
Symbolized by the conquest of the Americas in 1492 is the epoch of mercantilism and primitive accumulation.

Marked by the creation of a world market, the colonial system, and a trans-Atlantic economy.

## Second Stage of Capitalism
Competitive or classical capitalism is marked by the Industrial Revolution, the bourgeoisie, and the creation of modern nation-states like the American and French Revolution

## Third Stage of Capitalism
National corporate monopoly capitalism is marked by imperialist conquest and the rise of powerful national financial and industrial corporations. This becomes global capitalism by the 1970s, where a transnational capital is created where all nations and most humans are integrated in a global production and financial system.

Computer technology and other advances has led to global reach and advance over the global working classes. Now, people can search for the cheapest labor, lowest taxes, and laxest regulatory environments in the entire global economy through outsourcing across the planet.

## TCCs and TNCs
Therefore, a global economy emerges where everyone is integrated into this vast decentralized network of production, distribution, communication, and economy. This also led to the rise of a transnational capitalist class (TCC) as an agent of global capitalism, made up of owners and managers of giant transnational corporations and financial institutions that drive the global economy.
- ? So the TCC class has financial interest globally and organizes itself to pursue interests worldwide?
- '' The TCC directly instrumentalizes states around the world such that every country and the global economy is structurally dependent on transnational capital.
	- ? Any examples of these transnational companies or TCC?
	- & With that mutual corporation, states have to generate the conditions for transnational capital accumulation, and this means not only assuring a favorable climate for making profit but also repressing any threat to the rule of capital through social oppression

Capital in the world has been transnationally integrated and centralized within the TCC. Out of share ownership of public companies, core TNCs own each other companies, combining to own the majority of the world's revenues. 
- ex 17 global elites managed $41+ trillion, if not more.
- & So the great financial capital they have allows them to influence political and economic decisions worldwide? And countries make decisions together since these global elites influence many countries as they have money to influence many institutions on the TNS, such as advisors to international organizations like the World Bank, WTO, national governments, central banks, foreign affairs, defense, advisory roles to head of states, all to influence policies to protect their global capital. These policies are instructions to be followed by government puppets.
- star A global government system exists controlled by the TNCs as an oligarchy to force puppet nation-states to obey their rules of accumulating and retaining capital.

Primitive accumulation is where masses of people are violent separated from means of production (like land) such that it comes under control of capitalists. This forces people to join the capitalistic society.
- ex Britain's enclosure movement forced millions into the city to work as capitalistic workers.

## Global Capitalization
Three types of capitalistic crisis:
1. Cyclical recessions
2. Structural crises - solution is to restructure the system every 50 years involving breakdown of state legitimacy, escalating class struggles, and military conflicts
3. Existential crisis posed by ecological limits to the reproduction of the system such as climate change, nitrogen cycle, diversity loss, and overall mass extinction due to the mass and accelerated commodification of nature
	- & So climate change activists are under persecution because it goes against the nature of capitalism and the commodification of nature

Capitalism is naturally expansionary. Because there is nowhere else for it to expand to, it has begun to expand and commodify new resources - that is education, health, basic serves, etc - anything that people produce. **(p18)**
- This has led to global violence and social control under concentrated and privatized means of violence.
- ex The NSA in the US tapped every cable in the transatlantic cable to monitor recordings after 911. This was leaked by Edward Snowden. This has led many countries to stop routing cables through the US.

Global capitalism in this modern age, which is controlling information and monitoring data on humanity, lends itself to escalating tensions to create wars.
- The TCCs are controlling the states. Nation-states need to promote transnational capital accumulation in their nation but also need to achieve political legitimacy from their people. However, in this modern age of capitalist globalization, governments aim to attract national TNC investment, which incentives these countries with neo-liberal laws - downward pressure on wages, deregulation, low or no taxes, privatization. This is to aggravate inequality, impoverishment, and insecurity for the working classes to prevent rebellion.
- ex The Trump White house supported TNCs to invest in the US due to regression in taxes, deregulation, and limited tariffs.
- ? So are Republicans more in line with the funding from the TNCs while Democrats are against it? Then why do Democrats win US elections if the TNCs are so powerful in terms of money?

The TNC elites come together during the WEF event, an annual meeting in Davos. Thus, the Davos Man is used to describe the new global ruling class. WEF founder, Klaus Schwab, called for global leadership by the TCC to control money flow globally.
- ex Nestle, Toyota, Apple, McDonalds, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, etc
- They aim to unify and organize the various classes and factions to uphold their long term political interests against the exploited and oppressed classes around the world. 10% of global population do not have enough food or water consistently. Same with electricity. 10% of global populations live on <$1.9 a day and 45% live on <5.50 a day.

## The Overaccumulation Problem
Overaccumulation (to keep on gaining profits from capitalists) is expressed as a problem of overproduction or underconsumption. The wealth inequality gap grows between what is produced and what the market can absorb.
- & So capitalists gains huge surplus but do not find outlets to profitably invest that surplus.

The Fordism-Keynesianism idea is that high growth rates, rise in living standards for the working class, and a decrease in inequalities in the US,
- This was a result of Henry Ford's use of a new system of mass standardized production that could be sustained without introducing mass, standardized consumption.
- John Keynes believed that the governments need to intervene in the economy to regulate the market through public projects like infrastructure and social services, and minimum wages, unemployment insurance, pensions, etc.
- These adjustments stalled and offset overaccumulation and lowered the wealth gap.

This stopped in 1970s when the TCC abandoned that strategy and created a global capitalistic society. To counter the wealth of the middle class, they went on the offensive in class warfare.
- This restructuring meant tearing down obstacles to the free flow of global capital, having access to all raw resources, and opening up new spaces for expansion. This leads to the deregulation of markets and passage of free trade agreements. **(p25)**

The TCC increased global economic integration and transnational capital assisted with computer technology. This has led US to become a plutocracy, which growth was driven by small high-income clusters. As TNCs forced rules to benefit from the declining bargaining power of the working classes, increased globalization, lower anti-trust enforcement, technology to scale, lower taxes, interest rates, and tariffs, today exists the most pro-corporate environment in history globally.
- & 1% owned 50% of wealth. Top 20% owned 94.5% of wealth.
- & All US based companies sat on $1 trillion in uninvested cash while worldwide cash reserves topped $12 trillion. As TNCs cannot find opportunities to profitably reinvest their profits, they don't invest, leading to pressures to find outlets to upload their surplus. Thus, these TNCs pressure states to create profit making opportunities.
	- ex Financial speculation, plunder of public finances, debt driven growth, state organized militarized accumulation
- ? So stocks buy choices may be good based on how it affects the wealthy? Since the wealthy are who spends the most, by far, compared to everyone else? And avoid buying stocks in industries producing for mass consumption.

The TNCs keep trying to find outlets too unload their surplus. It began with real estate investment, stock market speculation, etc. After the 2008 crash, they reinvested into other markets, like cryptocurrencies, land around the world, etc.
- Now, growth is driven by mounting government, corporate, and consumer debt, with global debt reaching $215 trillion in 2020.
- Fictitious capitals grows more as financial speculation spirals more and more. Though the gross world product worldwide is $75 trillion, currency speculation alone amounts to $5.3 trillion a day ($1934 trillion a year), and global derivatives market was estimated at $1.2 quadrillion.

- ? I don't understand ABS and speculative investment in mortgages. How does that lead to fictitious money that does not correspond to real wealth? **(p29)**
- ? So government debt and bonds are now just financial speculation to offset the overaccumulation crisis?

Control over state finances allow the TCCs to control welfare and thus social control. The poor are begin targeted by transnational finance capital for financial extraction - forcing them into debt and dependence that allow the state to criminalize them, which again opens up opportunities for militarized accumulation by repression.
- ? What is militarized accumulation by repression? What is there to gain from sending people to jail?

In the modern age, computer technology is expected to become even more powerful to global capitalism. With 3D printing, IoT, robotics, AI, machine learning, bio and nano tech, cloud computing, energy storage, autonomous vehicles, drives forward a new revolution in global capitalism. 
- Data mining and analysis has become more expansive and allows new potential for social control and the central element in the development of a global police state. The tech sector and big data is now a major new outlet for surplus capital.
- Digitization sucks up more value from the global economy. Nearly all of Google's and Apple's revenue comes from advertising, while Uber and Airbnb skim value off the labor and resources of drivers, home owners, and their customers.
- Digitization promises to bring about high skilled and paid jobs and resolve the problems of social polarization and stagnation. But evidence suggests that digitalization may deskill or completely eliminate many jobs and exacerbate inequality.
- Although absolute volume of TNC profits has increased, the rate of profit declined an average of 10% to 6%, suggesting the accumulation crisis. Thus, war and a global police state may resolve this system's dilemma.
