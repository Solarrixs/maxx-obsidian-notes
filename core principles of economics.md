# Scarcity Principle
Unlimited wants and limited resources means that having more of something requires having less of something else. That is an opportunity cost, and people must face these trade-offs.

Thus, people must make choices to best use the scarce resources available. Scarcity in economics isn't a shortage of a resource. It's that a resource is scarce if something has to be given up to achieve something else, like time or money.

Resources is anything that can be used to produce something else:
- Land
- Labor
- Capital
- Human capital

In short, economics is the study of how people make choices under the scarcity principles and its results.

# Cost-Benefit Principle
Before you make any decision, you should:
- Evaluate costs and benefits associated with each choice
- Pursue the choice if benefits > costs

All simple choices has a cost. **For example, if you were paid 1 cent to get out of bed, you wouldn't. But if you were paid $1000 to get out of bed, you would.** Somewhere in between those values is the reservation price - your willingness to accept. There is also a willingness to pay.

The different between the benefits you gain and the costs you pay is your economic surplus. **Economic surplus = benefits - costs**. Good decisions maximizes or optimizes your economic surplus. Technically every decision you make increases your economic surplus as you avoid high costs and seek high benefits in each decision.

# Opportunity Cost Principle
Opportunity cost is the next best alternative you must give up to get the resource you primarily want.

All costs become opportunity costs, since every choice you make means forgoing other alternatives.

**Opportunity cost = direct monetary cost + net benefit of next best alternative**

# Sunk Costs
Costs that should be ignored when making decisions are called sunk costs. Sunk costs are costs that cannot be recovered and have no influence on a future action's actual costs and benefits.

# Marginal Principle
The marginal principle says that decisions about quantities are best made incrementally. Marginal indicates a difference between alternatives that represents only 1 unit more. **For example, should I stay one more day at vacation and pay one more night of expenses?**

The benefit you get from staying one more night is the marginal benefit, and the extra cost of that night is the marginal cost. In this situation, you should only compare the marginal benefits and costs.

Essentially, keep doing an action as long as your marginal benefits equal your marginal costs.

# Interdependence Principle
The interdependence principle states that your best choice depends on your choices and the choices other people make.

This will reach equilibrium, where everyone cannot do any better by picking another course of action because everyone is already maximizing their individual economic surplus. Nobody perceives they will benefit from changing their own behavior.

# Economic Models
Economic models only focus on the important things and ignores all the minor details.

Most economic models are positive economics:
1. cause-and-effect explanations of economic relationships
2. empirical (numerical) dimension where data can confirm or refute propositions'

There are also normative economics:
1. asks whether something should happen
2. reflects subjective value judgement such as ethical positions
