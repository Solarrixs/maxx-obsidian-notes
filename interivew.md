**1. If you could master one skill, what would it be, and why?**

I would master nanobiotechnology. As we stand on the precipice of technological advancements, the potential to manipulate materials on an atomic or molecular scale for biotechnological applications is profound. This skill would be instrumental in furthering my ambitions, such as creating Nano-neuro semiconductors, and harnessing the true potential of merging biology with technology.

**2. What are you the most curious about right now?**

I'm deeply fascinated by the emergence of synthetic intelligence through biological organoids. The idea of mimicking human intelligence without relying solely on traditional silicon-based devices captivates me. My startup idea, which revolves around powering computers using rat neurons, is a testament to this curiosity. Itâ€™s not just about blending the organic and digital but revolutionizing how we perceive computing. By pioneering the concept of "Nano-neuro semiconductors," I believe we can embark on a journey where biology and technology coalesce in ways previously deemed as science fiction.
