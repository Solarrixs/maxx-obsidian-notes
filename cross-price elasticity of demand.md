$\dfrac{\%\Delta Q_{D}\text{ of }A}{\%\Delta B_{\text{price}}}$

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another.
- If positive, then the two goods are substitutes. You buy more of a good when the price of another good goes up. A small cross-price elasticity means the goods aren't close substitutes
- If negative, then the two goods are complements. You buy less of a good when the price of another good goes up
