Before you make any decision, you should:
- Evaluate costs and benefits associated with each choice
- Pursue the choice if benefits > costs

All simple choices has a cost. **For example, if you were paid 1 cent to get out of bed, you wouldn't. But if you were paid $1000 to get out of bed, you would.** Somewhere in between those values is the reservation price - your willingness to accept. There is also a willingness to pay.

The different between the benefits you gain and the costs you pay is your economic surplus. **Economic surplus = benefits - costs**. Good decisions maximizes or optimizes your economic surplus. Technically every decision you make increases your economic surplus as you avoid high costs and seek high benefits in each decision.
