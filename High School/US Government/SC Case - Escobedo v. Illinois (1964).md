A [[supreme court]] case.

Escobedo is being questioned and wants to call his attorney, but is denied by the police. This ultimately leads to his conviction.

The Court decides that Escobedo's rights were violated of [[amendment#6th amendment]] and [[amendment#14th amendment]]. This sets the rule that a person must have the right to an attorney upon request.
