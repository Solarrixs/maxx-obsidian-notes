Have aspects of each branch of [[government]] wrapped into the commissions.
- They have executive, judicial, and legislative powers.

Typically very powerful because the people who run the organizations are hard to remove unless their term is up.
- This was made specifically to prevent people within the [[independent regulatory commissions]] to feel pressure from different institutes. Congress nor Presidents can force the heads to leave.

## Examples of Independent Regulatory Commissions
[[federal election campaign act|federal election commission]]
[[federal communications commission]]
FTC (regulation of business activities that have national implications)
JEC (regulation of stock markets)
[[federal reserve]] Board (conducts [[monetary policy]] for the US)
