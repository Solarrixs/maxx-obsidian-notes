Is not a form of [[government]], as all forms of government (except democracy) can be totalitarianism, so it is more of a style a government can function as. However, there is a tendency for government to amass more power, which leads them to become more totalitarian.

Democratic governments are hard to be totalitarian as the people have power to decide aspects of society.

Totalitarian government controls every public and private aspect of society. People no longer have any freedoms.
