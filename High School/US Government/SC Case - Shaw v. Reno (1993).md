A [[supreme court]] case that challenges the 12th congressional district in North Carolina for discriminating against whites living within it.

In a 5-4 court decision, they send a case back to the lower court and claimed that the district is "bizarre" and infers a racial [[gerrymandering]]. The court says that legislatures are not allowed to think about race when drawing congressional districts and thus must be able to be explained on grounds other than race. There must be a compelling government interest when drawing a district that takes race into account (strict scrutiny).

Previous courts ruled that legislative districts should be contiguous and compact.

The lower court forces them to draw a slightly less, but still [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] district.
