A [[supreme court]] case.

The Vietnam War is going on, and some students decided to protest the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands to school. However, the school bans this.

The question before the court was, does a prohibition on wearing black arm bands violate a student's freedom of speech?

The court decides that the school cannot interfere with the student's freedom of speech and expression. And since the speech did not "materially and substantially interfere" with the operation of the school, it should be allowed. However, the school has a lot of freedom in interfering with your rights since many things can be considered as "disruptive" to learning.
