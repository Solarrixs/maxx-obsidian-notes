The [[supreme court]] decided that public figures have a hard time proving libel because there must be actual malice - a reckless disregard for the truth or the intent to hurt with false information.

So if there is libel about a private person, they will win. But if there is libel about a public figure, they will not win. Because it is extremely hard to prove that someone didn't know a fact was true. If there were reasonable amounts of evidence showing non-malice, the public figure will lose.

Sullivan is in charge of the police departments in Alabama.

The NYT runs an ad supporting Martin Luther King. However, NYT writes untrue facts about Sullivan and his police department, and thus Sullivan sues.
