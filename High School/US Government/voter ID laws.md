Voter ID laws is used by 35 states, which enforces that people show ID when voting. [[republicans]] back this law up (it protects the integrity of the ballot. People who without IDs can cast provisional ballots and later provide proof as well) while [[democrats]] do not support this (they claim that it is unconstitutional and does not favor poor, minority, and elderly people who are not likely to comply nor have IDs, and there are no significant evidence of fraud in elections), yet a majority of people still support voter ID laws.
- ex Only very [[liberals|liberal]] states do not have voter ID laws like New York.
