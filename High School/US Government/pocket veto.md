The [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] says that if a president gets a bill and does not sign it within 10 business days (excluding Sunday), it automatically becomes law.

This is a reason for the President to distance themself from the bill.
- '' The President will not sign it and leave it to be automatically turned into law, so the President can say that they did not support it and did not sign it.

**However**, the pocket veto is when [[congress]] disbands for the last time near Christmas Eve, the President can just not sign it. However, instead of automatically being turned into law after 10 days, the bill will actually be automatically vetoed, since [[congress]] is disbanded.
