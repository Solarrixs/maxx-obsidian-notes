attempt to rein in the [[US president|president power]] of being [[commander in chief]], especially the fact that presidents can move troops into conflict and not declare war.

If president moves troops into a hostile area, the president must inform [[congress]] within 48 hours. congress then must either declare war or create authorization for the troop commitment. If congress does not grant authorization, the President has 60 days with an additional 30 days to withdraw the troops.

The congress can check the president by managing appropriations to the military and the war. By decreasing the amount of money given to the military, it can potentially end the war.

this is viewed as unconstitutional and an encroachment on presidential power, but has never been tested in the courts.
