A wide array of [[political interest groups]] have influence over the [[government]], but they may or may not choose to exercise their influence depending on the issue on hand.

A pluralist model of government allows for many different views to be represented on specific issues.
- '' If there is an issue that people don't know about, even in the absence of recognizing there is an issue, some [[political interest groups]] will represent their views on that particular issue.
- ex Regarding gun control issues, there are a multitude of [[political interest groups]] that have huge influence over gun control laws. If you personally support guns being owned (but aren't actively participating in it), the NRA is working towards your goal without you even advocating for it. Other unrelated elite groups, such as the NAACP, will not be involved in the issue regarding gun control issues, but if the issue concerns abortion, the NRA will withdraw their influence while NAACP will begin to be engaged in the issue.

Pluralist groups somewhat lends itself to the [[elitist theory of a democratic republic]] of [[democracy]]. Government officials now need to decide whether to side with the majority of the people or side with specific pluralist groups.
- However, having pluralist groups prevent [[tyranny of the majority]].
