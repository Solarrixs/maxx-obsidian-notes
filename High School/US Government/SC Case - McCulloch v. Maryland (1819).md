Focused on the issue of Maryland not liking the national bank of the [[government]], so Maryland taxes the bank, but McCulloch decides not to pay the taxes. This raises questions:
1. Does Maryland have the right to tax a bank?
2. Can the national government create a national bank?

The federal government needs a bank to carry out the federal government's [[delegated powers|enumerated powers]] through the [[elastic clause|necessary and proper clause]] within the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]]. Additionally, [[John Marshall]] claims that the power to tax is the power to destroy. So if Maryland was allowed to tax, they could tax the national bank out of existence, which violates the [[supremacy clause]] (national law is supreme over states if the laws conflicts).

The result expanded the federal government's power, which caused a lot of controversy and anger, and ties back into [[brutus no. 1]]'s claim that the [[elastic clause|necessary and proper clause]] would only allow the government to gain more powers.
