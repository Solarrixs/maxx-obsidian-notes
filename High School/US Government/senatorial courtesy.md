Every state gets 1 [[district courts]], which requires judges to be filled.

The [[US president|president]] doesn't appoint the judges in [[district courts]], but it's the [[senate|senators]] who give the [[US president|president]] a list of candidates for judges in their respective state.

Note that this only applies to district courts. There is no courtesy for higher courts, such as [[circuit courts]] or [[supreme court]].

## Blue Slip
Senators will fill this out for [[district courts]] judges that are going to potentially serve in their state. That means the 2 senators per state get to critique the nominated judges by the president.

If a senator doesn't fill it out, it shows a lack of support for the nominated judge by the [[US president|president]].
