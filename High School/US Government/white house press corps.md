Started by President Roosevelt in an attempt to cooperate with journalists instead of having an adversary relationship.

Transitioned the media to focus on the executive branch (mainly the President) than the legislative branch ([[house of representatives]] or [[congress]]).

 The[[white house press corps]] consists of 50 journalists with credentials to enter into the White House and holds conferences 5 days a week and sometimes have one-to-one meetings with the press secretary.

 There is also a lot of bias within the White House Press Corp, as the people who support a certain party will be favored by the White House.
