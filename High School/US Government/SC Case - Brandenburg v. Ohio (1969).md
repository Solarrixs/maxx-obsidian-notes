A [[supreme court]] case.

Bradenburg is a Ku Klux Klan leader and gives a speech that gets him arrested.

The question before the court is, has the state law violated Brandenburg's freedom of speech rights? Ohio says Brandenburg caused a clear and present danger according to the [[SC Case - Schenck v. US (1919)]].

The Supreme Court replaces "clear and present danger" with "imminent danger".

However, there is still a preferred position of free speech: the right of free speech and expression is given more weight than other rights when the court hears those types of cases, because they believe that free speech is the cornerstone of a [[indirect democracy|democratic republic]].
