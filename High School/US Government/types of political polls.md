The more selective the [[sample size|sample]], the more people needs to be sampled, which drives up the costs. However, selective samples also leads to accurate results, which is very important in [[political polls]].

A Poll: ages 18+
- not used a lot though because some adults can't even vote if they are illegal immigrants, in jail, etc

EV Poll: eligible voters (don't have to be registered to vote)

RV Poll: registered voters

**LV Poll**: likely voters
- best sample to lead to accurate results
