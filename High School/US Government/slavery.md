## Early United States
Slavery was an issue during the creation of the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] in the [[constitutional convention of 1787]].

Slaves were owned by many people in the early days of America and has led to the livelihoods of their lives.

The issue of slavery has led to many policies and compromises being made:
- ex [[3-5 compromise]]
- ex Return of fugitive slaves that have escaped to different states
- ex No stopping of importation of slaves until 1808 (20 year delay being banning the slave trade)
