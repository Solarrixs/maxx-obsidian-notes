The powers of the State and the federal [[government]] are not clear and distinctly separate.
Often times, they end up exercising similar powers often working together.
- In modern day, it seems like the US is moving more towards cooperative federalism and away from [[dual federalism]].
- ex Education is supposed to be a State controlled power, but recently, the federal government has forced certain states to do specific things. There is also a Department of Education, which makes a point that the federal government has found ways to encroach upon the [[reserved powers]] of the States.
- ex Healthcare is supposed to the regulated by the States. In the [[SARS-CoV-2|COVID19]] pandemic, many states looked towards the federal CDC for advice.

 The [[amendment#14th amendment|14th amendment]] throughout history has been cited in order to encroach upon the [[reserved powers]] of the states.
