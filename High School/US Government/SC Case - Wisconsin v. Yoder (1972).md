A [[supreme court]] case.

An Amish family does not their children going to school due to their religion.

The question before the court was, does compulsory education to the age of 16 violate the free exercise clause?

The court ruled that since compulsory education is not compatible with their lifestyle and religion, Wisconsin cannot force them to go to school.
