- ? What does this mean

After the [[House and Senate budget committees]], it is sent to the [[congressional budget office]] and does an analysis on the budget. The CBO and OMB might disagree a lot with the reported budget. Therefore, the [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]] needs to pass a budget resolution to lay out a framework for a spending blueprint. This is the budget that will be passed later.

After this, appropriations must be made for the budget in the [[house and senate appropriations committees]].
- [[earmarks]] can be made.
