The federal [[government]] has ways to force states to do things if the states don't want to. This is somewhat opposite of the [[fiscal federalism|carrot approach of federalism]].
1. Judicial Decisions to force a piece of legislation to become law
2. Military or Police Action to force pieces of legislation. The Little Rock desegregation was an example of military action to force desegregation.
