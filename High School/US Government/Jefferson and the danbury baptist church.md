dominant religion at the time was congregationalists. they were usually [[federalists]]. these congregationalists were scared that if [[Thomas Jefferson]] was elected as [[US president|president]], their religion will be outlawed. the baptists were happy that Jefferson won as they thought he did not support congregationalists.

Jefferson uses the phrase separation of Church and state in this letter. Jefferson said he can't do anything to help the baptists since the federal government can't do anything about religion but the state government could.

[[supreme court]] case of [[SC Case - Everson v. Board of Education (1947)]] and [[SC Case - Engel v. Vitale (1962)]] explored the role of separation of Church and state.

This focused on the free exercise and establish clause.
