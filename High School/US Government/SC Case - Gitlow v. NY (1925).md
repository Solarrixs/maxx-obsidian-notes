A [[supreme court]] case.

Gitlow is a [[socialism|socialist]] and writes a manifesto to convince people to strike and overthrow the New York [[government]]. Thus, NY arrests him. Gitlow however claimed that his free speech rights have been denied under the [[amendment#1st amendment]].

This is related to the [[SC Case - Barron v. Baltimore (1833)]] case, as technically the precedent that should be followed is that the amendments under the [[bill of rights]] only protect citizens from the national, not the state government.

However, the [[amendment#14th amendment]] states that no state can deprive a person of life/liberty without due process of law.

Thus, the supreme court establishes that freedom of speech is a right that states can't deny their citizens on the basis of the [[amendment#14th amendment]].

This establishes the [[selective incorporation doctrine]].
