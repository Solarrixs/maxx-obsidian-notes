[[supreme court]] case.

New Jersey school boards reimbursed parents for costs of busing their children to both public and private schools. 96% of the private schools however were Catholic schools.

The question was, does this violate the Establishment Clause of the [[amendment#1st amendment]]? Because most private schools were Catholic, so Everson claims that it attempts to establish the Catholic religion.

In a 5-4 decision, the court says no, it does violate the Establishment Clause. This is because payments were to the parents and did not directly support Catholic private schools.

Huge Black revives Jefferson's language of "Separation of Church and State" and states that it is not a violation of the that statement.
