Allowed 18 year olds the right to vote in all elections.

Who could vote is decided by the states within state elections. Thus, the states challenged this act, leading to the [[supreme court]] declaring that it was unconstitutional.

Afterwards, the [[amendment#26th amendment|26th Amendment]] was proposed in 1971 and was one of the fastest ratified amendment in history. This was due to 18-20 year olds being drafted to Vietnam, and thus the most people had issues with how 18 year olds could not have the right to vote even as they were being drafted.
