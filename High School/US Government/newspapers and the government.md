Began in 1690s throughout the colonies but mostly limited to the elites who were literate.

Early newspapers were partisan (biased) newspapers, designed to advocate for a certain view ([[Alexander Hamilton]]'s paper promoted the [[federalists]] and attempted to undermine other parties). These newspapers targeted those who could vote, which at the time were mostly elites.
