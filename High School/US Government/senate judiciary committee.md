All [[federal judges]] and justices above [[district courts]] levels have a much more intensive confirmation process. All [[senate|senators]] are able to have an input in selecting these judges, mainly because the [[circuit courts]] and [[supreme court]] will set policy-changing precedents.

This is in stark contrast to [[senatorial courtesy]] in selecting justices for [[district courts]].
