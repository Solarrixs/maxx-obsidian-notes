Certain and specific conditions must be met to achieve a certain purpose before a State can get money from the federal [[government]].
- '' A formula driven grant. The amount of money a state gets is calculated through a formula, usually determined by a State's population.
- The more people a State has, they will have access to greater money and more representation in the [[house of representatives]]

Some examples of categorical grants:
- ex medicaid - health insurance for poor people, but there has been an expansion of people qualifying for medicaid. This allowed the federal government to expand their reach. Whatever a state spends on medicaid, the federal government will provide matching funds, so every state has an incentive to spend more on medicaid.
- ex food stamp/snap benefits
