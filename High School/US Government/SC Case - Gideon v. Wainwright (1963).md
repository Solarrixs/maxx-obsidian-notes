A [[supreme court]] case.

Gideon is a homeless man in Florida and loiters near a building. Then he is accused of stealing stuff from the building. Since he is totally poor, he can't purchase an attorney, and is thus convicted and arrested.

The Court decides that Gideon's [[amendment#6th amendment]] and [[amendment#14th amendment]] rights were violated. Therefore, an attorney must be provided in all cases where a defendant can't afford one. This also results in "in forma pauperis" - the ability to file a case in the courts for free if not financially able to pay.

This is an example the [[selective incorporation doctrine]] applying to the [[amendment#6th amendment]].
