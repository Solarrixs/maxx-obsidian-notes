Powers that only the federal [[government]] can have in the US.

Article I Section 8 of the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] is where many of the powers are located.

The ability to tax, declare war, raise an army, regulate interstate commerce, etc.
- ? Can delegated powers be part of concurrent powers? I thought taxing as a concurrent power as the states can also tax but then why is it listed as a delegated power?
