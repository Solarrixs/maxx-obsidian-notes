Political machines is a highly centralized political party that dominates politics within a given area, which are usually a city or a county.
- '' They are experts at securing votes for victory in any political race.
- ex The most famous political machine was William Tweed in Tammany Hall.

Political machines were most widespread in 1800s to 1900s. The last two Republican political machines existed in Nassau and Brookhaven.

## How Did Political Machines Maintain Power?
Political machines basically did people favors like giving food and loans. They aren't all bad and are even seen as a positive force in certain areas.

However, all political machines die due to people having issues with the corruption and bribery of political machines. Taxpayers eventually became angry at the corrupt nature of the political machine.

## The Decline of Political Machines
The [[Progressive Era]] were key in bringing down political machines by the 1900s, which focused on health, safety, business regulation, exposing corruption through muckrakers, women's voting rights.

Progressives thought the political machines prevented [[democracy]] from occurring in the US and therefore they had goals of stopping political machines.

### Progressive Reforms
- [[political primary]] and [[caucus]] (did not affect political machines too much since the people who voted in primaries were usually people who are influenced by political machines)
- direct election of senators in the [[amendment#17th amendments (1913)]]. State legislatures were sometimes controlled by political machines, and so political machines had the power to influence state legislatures to select senators. After the amendment was passed, senators were forced to listen to the people and not to state legislatures under the control of political machines.
- voter registration laws were enforced. Prior to 1900s, people were allowed to vote multiple times, but after passing voter registration laws, people were restricted to one vote per election.
	- This prevented people from voting multiple times for political machines.
- australian ballot were used to allow people to vote in secret and were made uniformly. So nobody could tell who anyone else voted since all democrats and republicans were on 1 ballot instead of on 2 separate ballots. This prevented people who worked for political machines to force people to vote a certain way.

- [[initiative process]]
