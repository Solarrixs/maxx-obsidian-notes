The [[SC Case - Citizens United v. FEC (2010)]] [[supreme court]] decision leads to the creation of [[independent expenditure committees]], which can be created by anyone. This sets no contribution limits to these super PACS by corporations, nonprofits, and individuals, and thus treasury funds can be used to **finance any electioneering efforts** as long as it is uncoordinated.

This is way better than the 527s tax code loophole (see [[political action committee#soft money loophole]]).

This also kills the [[McCain-Feingold bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002]] and also replaces [[political action committee|PACs]]. Super PACS are widely used to finance campaigns, and any other method is way harder.
