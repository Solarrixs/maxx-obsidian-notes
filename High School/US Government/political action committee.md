In 1925, it was made illegal for corporations and labor unions to donate money to federal campaigns. However, this is hard to track and enforce, so they made it legal by regulating it through the [[federal election campaign act#federal election commission|F.E.C]].

A [[political action committee]] (PAC) was created as a legal fund raising organization for corporations (including non-profit [[501(c4)]] and [[501(c3)]] organizations), labor unions, and [[political interest groups]] to donate to campaigns. This is known as **hard money**, which is any money donated directly to a candidate's campaign committee. This must be reported to the [[federal election campaign act|F.E.C]]. Anyone can start [[political action committee|PACs]].

Each candidate can receive up to $5000 in hard money donations by a PAC or $2800 in donations from individuals during both the [[political primary|primary]] election and a general election.

However, if the PAC wishes to spent hard money independently of a campaign on a candidate's behalf, they are allowed to spent as much money as they need.
- This is only allowed if it is uncoordinated with the candidate's campaign.
- ex Ads on TV, signs, etc

There is also a more specific type of PAC: [[leadership PAC]].

## Soft Money Loophole
Money can be donated directly to the [[political national committees]] with no limit on maximum donations. This money wasn't regulated by the [[federal election campaign act|F.E.C]], leading to any individual or corporation or labor union donating as much money as they want to the [[political national committees]].

Although soft money should only be used for "party building activities" such as administrative costs, soft money is often used to fund campaign elections as well.

The [[McCain-Feingold bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002]] aimed to prevent this soft money loophole. However, this just led to another loophole: as much money can be spent on ads within the 527s tax code, as long as it does not expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate.

[[political action committee|PACs]] are no longer used anymore as most people would rather use [[independent expenditure committees|super PACs]] instead.
