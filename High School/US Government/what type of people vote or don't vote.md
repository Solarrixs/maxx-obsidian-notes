## What Type of People Don't Vote?
- People who don't know a lot (low internal efficacy)
- Minority groups in general (except blacks since it is ingrained in their culture)
- People of low education (schooling) or information (less information about politics)
- Poorer people who focus more on work than voting
- Young people (only ~50% of people aged 18-29yrs vote while the nation average is 60%). Mostly Democrats target young people to vote. Young people also tend to move around more, causing them to not be registered within a state and hampering their voting ability.

## What Type of People Vote?
- People who are educated and of higher income
- Older ages around 45-64 (which is the highest turnout group of about 70%). They have property, or have assets that's important related to the economy. The 65+ age group votes slightly lower than 70%. Older people also have more stake in government policies like [[social security]].
