Grants are usually given with something known as conditions of aid.
- This is essentially the federal [[government]] giving money to states to compel them into making laws that the federal government wants. If the states doesn't take the conditions of aid, they lose out on potential money that the states taxpayers are paying to the federal government.
- ex Drinking ages were raised to 21 in all states because the federal government offered money for highways only if states forced a 21 drinking age.

There are 3 types of governmental grants
1. [[categorical grant]]
2. [[block grant]]
3. [[revenue sharing]]
