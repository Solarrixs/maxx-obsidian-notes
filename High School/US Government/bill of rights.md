## Proposal
Proposed by the [[anti-federalists]] to guarantee safety and protection from the central [[government]] in order for them to ratify the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]].

[[James Madison]] and other [[federalists]] do not want to ratify the [[bill of rights]].
1. Most states already had their Bill of Rights. This showed that states had huge power to protect their citizen's safety.
2. There is potential for the Bill of Rights to be taken as the only rights people are entitled to.
3. The federal government only has power delegated to it by the states. The federal power cannot have more powers than it can be given by the states.
	- However, a central government usually gets more power over time. This reasoning is argued by [[brutus no. 1]].
	- ex In modern example, the federal government is considered way stronger than the state governments. This is heavily influenced by [[supreme court]] decisions.
4. The Constitution itself includes specific limitations on powers of the national government.
	- The federalist argues that even the federalists are wary of a central government and emphasize that the Constitution also works in the citizens favor by protecting their rights, such as ex post facto laws, religious laws, nobility rules, etc.
5. There is an [[amendment process]] to change the Constitution.

However, in the end, Madison writes the Bill of Rights.
