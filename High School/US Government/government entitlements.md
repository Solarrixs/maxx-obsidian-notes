Entitlements are programs created by law that people if qualified have a legal right to.
- ex Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc

Spending on these programs falls outside of [[the US appropriations and budget process]]. Rather, spending on these programs are automatic unless new legislation is passed to change the obligation of the [[government]] and amend the previous legislation. Every fiscal year, these entitlements must be paid and covered no matter what, even if that means taking new debt.
- However, it is basically impossible to change entitlements as they benefit a huge amount of people. If someone wants to take away the entitlements, they would face huge political backlash and likely not be re-elected.
