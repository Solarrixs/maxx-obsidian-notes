A return of powers to the states from the federal [[government]] in some policy areas. Many people referred to the tenth [[amendment]] for the states to have more power.

This results in more [[block grant]]s being used.

This was an absolute failure though, as it is ineffective and did not really reverse the gains of federal power.
