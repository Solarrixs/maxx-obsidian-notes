A rebellion in western Massachusetts led by Daniel Shays and followed by about 1000 other farmers. Initially, they interfere with the work of judges and court systems to prevent foreclosure notices. Eventually, they raid an arsenal, which led them to be suppressed. Therefore, the rebellion fails.

This was due to high taxes imposed upon them, causing them to lose their land and thus their livelihood. This was believed to be due to unfair tax systems created by the governmental elites in Massachusetts.

The surface level reasoning was because of high and unfair taxes.
The deeper level reasoning was because Daniel Shays, and other Revolutionary veterans literally just fought a war against Great Britain because of unfair ruling and taxes.

Shays' Rebellion highlighted the weaknesses of the [[articles of confederation|AoC]]. When the rebellion starts, the governor calls [[congress]] for an army to suppress the rebellion, but the Congress doesn't have an army.
