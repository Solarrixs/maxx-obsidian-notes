The right to keep private communications private on the part of the [[US president]]. It may be extended to those who work for the [[US president|president]].
- There are people who should be able directly communicate and advise the [[US president|president]], but without fear of backlash from the public.

Additionally, in a divided [[government]], the president will claim executive privilege to prevent giving the other party info they want.

The executive privilege can also protect the nation through national security.

The [[SC Case - US v. Nixon (1974)]] concerns executive privilege.
