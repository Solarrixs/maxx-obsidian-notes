## Proposal
The creation of the US Constitution was in part motivated from the failures of the [[articles of confederation]].

The US constitution was created after the [[annapolis convention of 1786]] but during the [[constitutional convention of 1787]] and was largely inspired by the compromises made by the [[new jersey plan]] and the [[virginia plan]]. However, once it was sent to the states, it was still very hard to ratify it.

A majority of the people were concerned about the US [[government]] returning to a totalitarian government similar to the British government. This immediately leads to 2 dominant factions rising up: the [[federalists]] and the [[anti-federalists]] who begin convincing people of their own personal opinions.

## Ratification
1788, the Constitution is ratified by 9 states. Big states like New York and Virginia did not ratify the Constitution yet.

1789, [[James Madison]] proposes a [[bill of rights]].

1790, the Constitution is ratified by all states. Rhode Island is the last state to ratify.

1791, the Bill of Rights is ratified.
