No [[government]] is [[anarchy]].

Most governments are split between: [[dictatorship]], [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], [[theocracy]].
- Governments with few people in charge have more power to exercise laws and set legislation as there is less debate over making decisions. This makes [[monarchy|monarchies]] and [[dictatorship|dictatorships]] more powerful than [[oligarchy|oligarchies]] or [[theocracy|theocracies]], which are more powerful than [[democracy|democracies]].
