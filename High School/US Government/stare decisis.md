The rule of precedent, whereby a rule or laws interpretation in a judicial decision is viewed as binding on judges whenever the same question is presented.
- Judges do break precedent at times though, [[SC Case - Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)]] and [[SC Case - Brown v. Board of Education (1954)]], completely reversing the precedent.
- Precedent is what is supposed to give us uniformity preventing any arbitrariness of the law.

Only [[circuit courts]] and [[supreme court]] has the ability to set precedents.
