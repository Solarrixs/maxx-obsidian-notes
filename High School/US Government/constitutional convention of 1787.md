Occurs after [[shays' rebellion of 1786]] in hopes of revising the [[articles of confederation]]

12 states show out of 13. Only Rhode Island doesn't come.

This convention aimed to strengthen the economy and commerce (initially). In fact, part of the Shays' Rebellion was motivated by the horrible [[economic systems]] of the US.

[[James Madison]] is the leading head for the Constitutional Convention. He brings up his plan for creating a new government instead of revising the [[articles of confederation|AoC]]. The plan is called the [[virginia plan]].

However, states with smaller population felt that the [[virginia plan]] was too biased towards larger population states, so they hastily made the [[new jersey plan]].
