Applying the [[bill of rights]] on a case by case basis to the states. This happens through the use of the [[amendment#14th amendment]] due process clause or the privileges and immunities clause.
- ex The [[amendment#1st amendment]] of freedom of speech clause is selectively incorporated through the [[SC Case - Gitlow v. NY (1925)]] case.

Most of the [[bill of rights]] have been selectively incorporated. Only amendments 3 and 7 are not incorporated, and amendments 9 and 10 is not applicable to be incorporated. A portion of the 5th and 6th amendments have also not been incorporated (grand jury indictment, right to jury).

This ultimately decreases the power of the states.
