a meeting where people running for a political office try to convince others to support their choice for nominee in the [[political primary]].

after county conventions, state conventions will choose how many delegates per representative to head to the [[national party convention]].

[[republicans|republican]] caucuses are the same as [[political primary|political primaries]].

[[democrats|democrat]] caucuses are totally different. There are no secret ballots and people vote by moving into groups. If a given representative receives more than 15% of popular support, they have viability.

Typically, the first caucus to go is the [[iowa caucus]].
