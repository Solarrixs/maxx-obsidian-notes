The [[amendment#1st amendment]] should guarantee freedom of speech, however, many private corporations and the [[government]] regulate the media through editorial discretion. Major social media services also have special protections against what you can write over.

Print media has a long history of no regulation (but it still has to obey the law such as not writing false things about people). People should be able to say whatever they want in print form. Thus, there is no formal [[government]] regulation on print, but there are still many case laws regarding print.
- ex [[SC Case - NYT v. US (1971)]] supported no prior restraint on print media. Greatly expanded the freedom of press.

Broadcast media is more powerful than print media once the radio was invented. As radios can be passively understood, people believed that broadcast media should be regulated. People were worried about whether radio could manipulate people into believing different things and influencing the masses. The [[Radio Act of 1927]] limits what broadcast can use which frequencies.

## Libel Laws
[[SC Case - NYT v. Sullivan (1964)]] gave protection to libel for private individuals but not really to public figures.

The [[federal communications commission]] made many libel laws related to media.
