The typical goal of gerrymandering is to obtain a "safe seat" - a win of over 55% for the winner. Marginal seats is when the winner wins by <55%.

When a congressional district is drawn to benefit a particular party of individual in getting elected. This is achieved through cracking or packing.
1. Packing is when you add more people of a certain party to a region such that that party would have an easier time winning due to the influx of people who favor said party.
2. Cracking the district is to dilute the vote, by taking some people of a party to a surrounding district where they won't have much impact.
- ex Moving republicans from a republican district to a democrat district such that both districts will result in a democratic victory. Look at the right-most graph below.
