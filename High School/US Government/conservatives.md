[[government]] should help provide for **equality of opportunity**. Generally supports [[republicans]]
- ex for education, every person should have the same opportunity of merit when applying to colleges

government should pass legislation to help it remain moral. Generally based on judaeo/christian values, and thus justified by religious reasoning.
- There is something known as a Culture War, a battle over public and private morality, which encompasses gay rights, gun laws, LGTBQ, etc.
- Around 1968, there is a more defined Culture War between secular and judaeo/christian views of moral values. Before 1968, religion was the moral factor for most people, but after 1968, religion was no longer as prominent as secularism increases.
- ex for drugs, either you have the right to your body or you are a temple for God, which leads to opposite reasonings and outcomes.
- ? why 1968, and what is culture war?

In economics and businesses, government is a force that needs to be controlled and limited, as government involvement can disrupt and distort economic markets, and therefore government regulation should be limited.
