Iowa has the 1st presidential [[caucus]] in each presidential election cycle since 1972.
- '' Iowa has prided themselves in having the 1st caucus for every presidential election. This also ensures that the money spent in Iowa during the Iowa caucus will be beneficial to the state economy.
- Prior to 1972, [[political primary|primaries]] and caucuses did not have as much influence in choosing a nominee as the state and local party bosses had.

This means that Iowa gets to shape who will end up being the nominee. Thus, other states attempt to leapfrog their their [[political primary|primaries]] earlier than Iowa, but that did not work.
- So if you lose badly at Iowa, you basically have to drop out of the presidential race. Thus, Iowa is able to eliminate certain people from participating in the race.
- If you win top three in Iowa, media attention and money come easier to the participants.

Since 1972, the Iowa caucus has correctly chosen 6 democrat nominees (2 becomes president) and 2 republican nominees (1 president).
The democratic [[political national committees|national committees]] ensured that Iowa could go first.

## Why is Iowa a Good First Caucus for Elections?
Iowa has a cheap [[9. mass media and the government|media]] market, and it is cheap to buy airtime and ads. This means that running a caucus in Iowa means that nominees do not need a ton of money to compete against other nominees.

It tests retail politics (idea of nominees going out to meet the voters) to test the candidates. It tests the ability of the nominee to connect with the individuals in the 99 counties of Iowa.
