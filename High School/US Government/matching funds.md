Only applies to presidential [[political primary]] and [[caucus]].

Matching funds system is created. If multiple people are running for a [[political primary|primary]], they can qualify for matching funds.
- To have the [[government]] match your funds, candidates must raise $5000+ in  20 states in donations of $250 or less. Matching funds are capped at $50,000,000
- Once the matching fund qualifications is reached, candidates get Secret Service protection.

The money that president races gain from matching funds are the only money they can use for running for election. Thus, top tier and most viable candidates often don't take matching funds since they can raise more money than the matching funds can provide. Many presidents don't participate in the matching fund system.
