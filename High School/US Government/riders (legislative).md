Non-germane amendments to a bill are known as riders.
- Used to bring specific [[senate|senator]] on board with a bill.
- This eventually leads to an over-convoluted and non-germane bill that focuses on many different things.

Typically added by the [[senate]], since any [[senate|senator]] can offer riders or amendments to a bill.
- Thus, tabling a bill doesn't matter that much in the [[senate]] compared to the [[house of representatives]] since it can always be added as a rider to another bill that makes it to the floor of the [[senate]].

Oftentimes, a [[senate]] bill and a [[house of representatives]] bill will be totally different due to the riders on a bill. Thus, a [[conference committee]] is used to hammer out a singular version of the bill.
