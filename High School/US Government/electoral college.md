Every state has electors that are equal to their number of members in the [[house of representatives]] and their two [[senate|senators]].
- The electors are not the senators or representative, but the number of electors are equal to 2 + the number of representatives. The total amount of electors is 538 (435 representatives, 100 senators, 3 from Washington DC due to the [[amendment#23rd amendment]])
- The smallest populated states are guaranteed 3 electors.

The [[US president|president]] requires 270 electoral votes to win the election.
- If the president wins the popular vote in a state (through a [[plurality vote]]), the president receives all the electors from the state.
- In the event no one gets to 270 electoral votes the [[house of representatives]] votes to choose a president. They get one vote per state delegation and must vote for one of the top three electoral vote winners for president. (Established by the 12th [[amendment]] in 1804)

[[political parties]], including [[political third parties]], in each state chooses a slate of electors, which are extreme loyalists for the party that were chosen by.
- Whichever party’s presidential candidate wins the popular vote in the state is allowed to have their electors cast a vote in the Electoral College in the state capitals in December. Therefore, the winner of the election night is actually determined in December. Electoral votes are counted before a joint session of the new [[congress]] in January by the Vice President.

## Why Use the Electoral College?
1. Framers didn’t trust the voters - [[elitist theory of a democratic republic]].
2. Small states receive some protection from large populated states. Small states voting power is significantly enhanced in the Electoral College because of the 2 senate based electors. This makes it possible for small states to be the deciding factor in close Electoral College votes.
3. Electoral College was intended to force presidential candidates to campaign in small population states. A strategy of just focusing on high population states usually won’t result in a win.
4. The winner take all system allows minorities to have greater political influence. In some states the way a minority group votes can be the difference between winning and losing all of the electoral votes of that state, because of the winner take all system.
5. Greater legitimacy for the winner. The Electoral College vote is often more pronounced than the popular vote tally.
6. Each state is voting in a democratic fashion on a state by state basis. Otherwise a national popular vote based model would allow a large state like California to supply all of the votes necessary for one candidate to win overall.

## Why Oppose the Electoral College?
1. Not democratic. The popular vote nationally is negated.
2. Not necessary any longer, since there are less sectional differences among citizens of the country and modern [[9. mass media and the government|mass media]] gives each candidate a presence in each state. People are also better educated and should be trusted because of compulsory education.

The Electoral College is likely here to stay. It would require a constitutional amendment to get rid of it.  This would mean 3/4 of the states would have to ratify.  Small states are not willing to give up something that gives them additional power.
