[[US president|president]] making appointments to different areas of the federal [[government]].

If president appoints someone when [[congress]] is not in session, the appointee is automatically promoted. This lets the president get around the advise and consent role of the [[senate]].

However, if the Senate is controlled by the opposite party, the party will hold a "mock" senate in-session meeting. So only a few Senators will stay behind and hold daily meetings of literally 3 minutes and then leaves. Therefore, congress would always be in session.
