Originated from colonists having difficulty with commerce after the establishment of the [[articles of confederation]]. [[George Washington]] and [[James Madison]] recognizes the problem with trading soon.

In meetings between Virginia and Maryland, the states agreed with trade regulation and rules and were really successful. Therefore, Washington and Madison calls a general convention - called the [[annapolis convention of 1786]].

Only 5 out of 13 states show up to discuss the commercial difficulties between states. This showed the general lack of interest and national unity between the states. The 5 states simply call a new meeting in Philadelphia with the intention of changing the [[articles of confederation]].

[[shays' rebellion of 1786]] occurs during this meeting.
