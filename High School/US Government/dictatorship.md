Similar to [[monarchy|monarchies]] but dictatorships seize power through military force (dictators are usually a high ranking military general with loyal military subordinates to overthrow a government) or refuse to leave power if they have lots of public support.

Once they come to power, they refuse to leave, if they have a lot of public support.
- ex Trump can be seen as a dictatorship (Jan 6 Capital Riots).
- ex Castro, Kim Jong Un (inherited dictatorship), etc.
