A [[supreme court]] case.

Miranda is forced to sign a confession that he committed a crime, but his lawyers believe his [[amendment#5th amendment]] and [[amendment#6th amendment]] rights were violated. And since his due process rights were violated, it was also a violation of the [[amendment#14th amendment]].

The Court decides that individuals who are arrested must be made aware of their rights, which is known as [[miranda rights]].
