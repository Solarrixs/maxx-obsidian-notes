Addresses the [[judicial branch]] of the US [[government]].

Branch is consisted of 4 different courts: [[supreme court]], [[district courts]], [[circuit courts]], and a Court of International Trade.

## Section I
Judges are appointed by the [[US president|president]] with the consent of the [[senate]], and serve for life. Salaries of the judges are also not to be decreased while they are in office - preventing members of [[congress]] from influencing a judge.

## Section II
federal courts have the power to decide how the [[constitution (US)]] is interpreted in relationship with the legislation passed by [[congress]]. The courts, however, cannot create their own cases, and must be brought by an individual who have been affected by the law.

All federal cases are to start at district courts and moved up to the [[circuit courts]] or [[supreme court]] given a 4/9 vote to hear the case (see: [[rule of four]]).

Defendants are guaranteed to have their cases heard by a jury in the state where the crime took place.

## Section III
mainly concerns [[treason]] as it is the only crime that is specifically defined within the [[constitution (US)]].

Conviction of treason should be based on either the testimony of 2 witnesses or when an accused person admits being guilty in an open court.

Congress can set the punishment, but such punishment should only be directed to the guilty individual and not his or her family or friends if they did not participate in the crime.
