Are groups of people, or organizations, with similar values and goals that wishes to influence legislation and public [[government]] policy.
- '' Interest groups are doing your bidding even without you knowing that you have that view on a certain issue.

Interest groups can affect public government policy by:
1. Influencing elections: either through money or by getting members to vote
2. Educating the masses to turn public opinion

## Transgender Interest Groups
Prior to the 1990s, transgenderism was very rare and was not an important issue. Within just 20 years, the majority of public opinion supports transgenderism, leading to the presence of gays in TV shows or promoting transgenderism to elementary school students.

This was done through the transgender interest groups, who mainly shifted public opinion to have mass support. This leads to the passage of gay marriage laws in many states.

## Types of Interest Groups
1. Institutional: made up of organizations
	- ex US Chamber of Commerce, Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, National Miners Association, National Educators Association, AFL-CIO
		- ex The Alliance of Auto Manufacturers is made up of various car manufacturing organizations
	- Easy time raising money because the funds used to promote institutional groups may provide huge economic benefits. This allows them to influence politicians due to their huge funding potential. Also, since not a lot of people care about institutional interest groups, public backlash is extremely low and leads to little opposition. This is the most powerful type of interest group.
	- '' They operate in stealth - less public attention means they can do more stuff
2. Membership: made up of a collection of individuals
	- ex NRA, Sierra Club, AARP, ACLU, AAA, National Organization for Women, ABA, AMA, [[political parties]] like [[democrats]] and [[republicans]]
	- ex The AARP has economic incentives + members, making it the most powerful interest group in the US. The AARP also consists of mostly people older than 45, and those are the types of people that vote a lot in elections. Therefore, the AARP has a huge influence on elections as well.
	- Most people care about membership interest groups since they focus on more "emotional" issues, leading to widespread public awareness. This can be bad though, since it can lead to public backlash.

the most important factors that lead to the success of interest groups are their size and the amount of money they have. A greater size typically results in greater money. However, there can be also be small size but a lot of money, such as the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers.

## Why Do People Join Interest Groups
1. economic incentives: all institutional groups, some membership groups (AARP). Joining these groups grant some sort of financial benefit, and is thus the most powerful reason why people join interest group.
2. material incentive: membership interest groups often provide material incentives if you join such as bags or magazines.
3. purposive incentive: when people agree with the goals or values of the interest group so they join. These are more-so used by membership interest groups.
4. solidarity incentive: when people want to be around and socialize with people of similar ideas.

## Achieving the Goals of Interest Groups
[[lobbying]]
[[political interest groups testify before Congress]]
[[political interest groups at social events]]
[[political interest groups offer donations]]
[[political interest groups offer endorsements]]
[[political interest groups go through court action]]
[[political interest groups can rally membership]]
[[political interest groups can put out propaganda]]

## Regulation of Interest Groups
Influence Peddling: using one's past or present position in the government for personal gain. This is because many government officials want to become a [[lobbying|lobbyist]], so they help political interest groups lobby for certain positions even if they hold a government position.
- ex An investigation into Joe Biden is underway to see whether Biden used his position or past position for financial gain
- Leads to revolving door: people will move between government jobs and private sectors numerous times. This leads to the potential of them getting rich unfairly by working for private gain.

### Legislations
1. Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act (1946), superseded by the Lobbying Disclosure Act (1995)
	- Lobbyists must register with the House + Senate if they work over a certain threshold for lobbying
	- Must file financial reports - how have they spent money for lobbying?
	- Enforced by the US Attorney's Office in DC and Department of Justice, but is hard to enforce this law.
	- ? why is it hard to enforce this law?
2. Interest groups are structured as non-profit corporations. The IRS is responsible for enforcing tax code, which dictates the things that interest groups can accomplish.
	- ex 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 organizations
	- The amount of political influence an interest group is allowed to engage in is determined by their designation of 501(c)3 or 501(c)4.
3. Ethics in Government Act (1978)
	- High level [[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] in all branches of [[government]] must file financial disclosure forms under the Office of Government Ethics. This requires richer government officials to disclose their financial sources and income.
	- High level [[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] are restricted from [[lobbying]] anyone before the agency for a year after leaving. This is basically a "cool off period". However, a loophole is just to act as a consultant for [[lobbying|lobbyist]].
	- Lobbying restriction can be extended to 2 years if the issue was within the individuals realm of influence at the government agency. This means that a "cool off period" can be extended for 2 years.
	- On matters in which a bureaucrat was directly involved, there is a lifetime ban on lobbying.
	- Restricts the ability of bureaucrats to negotiate future employment without notifying the Office of Personal Management.
	- This attempts to prevent government officials from conducting influence peddling during office or to use previous connections in the government.
	- [[congress]] are bound by similar guidelines but under the supervision of the [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]] Ethics Committees. However, it is not heavily influenced because then they will limit their own futures. Rather, since it is beneficial for all House and Senate members, the Congress often does not influence the law.
4. Ethics Reform Act (1989)
	- Creates a 1 year restriction on lobbying after leaving [[congress]]. It can also extend to high level staffers above a certain pay grade.
	- However, there is a lack of seriousness regarding this law since 1 year is too short for connections to dissipate.
5. Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (2007)
	- [[house of representatives]] maintain their 1 year cooling off period on [[lobbying]].
	- [[senate]] cooling off period is extended to 2 years.
	- Restricts gifts to members of Congress to $50 and restricts travel paid by special [[political interest groups]].
	- Increases penalties and fines associated with the aforementioned things.

## 501(c)3
Charitable organizations. Contributions are tax deductible and exempt from taxes. Many interest groups have components that have 501(c)3 tax code, which allows more people to fund these interest groups as the people will decrease their tax percentage. People working at 501(c)3 organizations still need to pay tax though.

Organizations under 501(c)3 code cannot work to elect or defeat candidates, but they are allowed to work to influence legislation or policy to some extent as long as it aligns with their basic needs (narrow in scope). Generally no endorsements allowed.
- ex Reform Judaism are 501(c)3 organizations and do not pay taxes. However, they still work to support [[democrats]]. Therefore, the IRS threatens the 501(c)3 status of Jewish churches.
- ex Black Churches also do the same thing as they always endorse [[democrats]] speakers.
- ex The Catholic Church has consistently lobbied to make abortion illegal, which is legal because the Catholic Church has historically stated their cause against abortions. The American Heart Association can lobby to have more funding as well. But organizations cannot influence policies in areas outside of their narrow scope.

## 501(c)4
Most interest groups are 501(c)4, which are known as social welfare organization. Contributions to 501(c)4 are non-tax deductible, but these organizations are still tax exempt.

Ratings, release issue ads (as long as it does not specifically endorse a candidate), endorsements, and lobbying are allowed for these organizations, and are thus able to influence elections, as long as it is not their primary function.
