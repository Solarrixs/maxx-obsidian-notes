Smith wanted to vote in the primary, but due to the enforcement of the [[political primary#white primaries]] in the South, he was denied the right to vote in the primary. As the [[democrats|democratic party]] is a private organization, they did not wish to include blacks as part of their members.
- This wasn't the first case of a black man being denied in a white primary.

However, the [[supreme court]] ruled that because of the unique role of parties in determining public elections, parties cannot discriminate blacks as it violated both the [[amendment#14th amendment|14th amendment]] and [[amendment#15th amendment|15th amendment]].
