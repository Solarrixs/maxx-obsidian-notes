Buckley wins a Senate seat in NY as a [[conservatives|conservative]] third party candidate, even though NY was normally extremely [[liberals|liberal]].

The [[federal election campaign act#federal election commission|FEC]] limited the amount of personal money spent on campaign to $50,000. This prevented Buckley from campaigning using his own money.

So can individuals be prevented from spending their own money on their own campaign or for others campaigns?
- Form of independent expenditure: non-coordinated funding to the campaign.

The [[supreme court]] decision eventually decided that this was unconstitutional: the law cannot restrict people from practicing independent expenditure, or spending money on their own campaigns.
- ? However, this was limited to only Senate races?
