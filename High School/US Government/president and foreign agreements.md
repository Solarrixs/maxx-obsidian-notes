trade agreements - about tariffs or trade. This doesn't count as a foreign policy treaty, and instead must be passed in both the [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]].

executive agreements - when the president conducts foreign policy, they can enter into executive agreements, often secret with a foreign head of state. This does not carry over from president to president.
