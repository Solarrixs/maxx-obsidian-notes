A [[supreme court]] case.

The Brady Legislation was passed where background checks are required to be done before someone can buy a gun. But before a computer system was developed in the 21st century, it led the federal government to force police officers to do background checks on people. This took up a lot of time and money from the officers, however.

This was a [[governmental mandates#Unfunded Mandates|unfunded mandate]].

The question was, can the federal [[government]] make a state agency carry out federal laws or regulations through the [[elastic clause|necessary and proper clause]]?

In a 5-4 decision, the necessary and proper clause does not allow the federal government to compel states to carry out a federal function under the [[interstate commerce clause]]. This essentially pushes back the expanding federal government's power over the states.
