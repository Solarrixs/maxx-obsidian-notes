- Must be split between 3 [[democrats]] and 3 [[republicans]].
- Presidents can also leave a spot vacant so the party with majority within the Federal Election Commission.
- Usually, this commission is deadlocked due to the even split of democrats and republicans.

## Functions of the Federal Election Commission
1. Publicly disclose campaign finance data for federal campaigns.
2. Oversee public funding of presidential elections **and** matching funds during [[political primary|political primaries]]. This is financed by taxpayers by checking a box on tax forms, donating $3 to the fund.
3. Enforce and clarify policies, sometimes in a regulatory body.

These functions were challenged by the [[SC Case - Buckley v. Valeo (1976)]] [[supreme court]] decision.
