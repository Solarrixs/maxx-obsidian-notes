[[introduction of bills in congress]]
[[indicators of a successful bill passage]]

All revenue (tax) bills **must start** within the [[house of representatives]].
- The reasoning is that the [[house of representatives]] is closer to the people (due to their 2 year election cycle) and thus represents the wills of the people more accurately.

All other bills can be started in both the [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]].

## House of Representatives Procedures
In the [[house of representatives]], if the majority leadership doesn't support the bill, it is likely not to be passed.
- In most cases, bills get tabled after being referred to the subcommittee of a committee. If the subcommittees support the bill, the subcommittee members will meet with [[political interest groups]] and [[lobbying|lobbyists]], do some research, hearings, etc. The most substantial event is for the subcommittee to schedule a markup: a series of amendments to a bill to "improve it," either by adding more stuff to get more people on board, or to water down and weaken some aspects to garner more support.
- Everything is scheduled by the committee chairs. They can decide to schedule it at the bottom, and thus never get reviewed. So, committee chairs needs to be on board with the bill as well.

Bills are then sent back to the full committee to be debated again depending on when the chairman scheduled it. The bill passes if there is a simple majority, otherwise it will be tabled.

Once passed, the bills are sent to the [[congress rules committees|house rules committees]] and then sent to the floor for a vote. If passed, the bill is moved to the [[senate]] and referred to the appropriate committee(s).

## Senate Procedures
In the [[senate]], any senator can place a hold on a bill or appointees at any time during the legislative process. The hold is a courtesy policy though, so it can be ignored and bypassed if there is an opposing majority. Holds are still used judicially for a bill they seriously disagree with, such as a bill negatively affecting the entire state (hurting industries, confirming Presidential appointees who will impact the state).
- Holds can be done at any time during the legislative process within the [[senate]] and lasts indefinitely.
- If an action is taken on a bill that a [[senate|senator]] had placed a hold on, the [[senate|senator]] will be notified immediately.
- Serves as an indication of a [[filibuster]].

Everything else along the [[senate]] legislative process is the same as the [[house of representatives]] legislative process (passes with a simple majority through each committee and subcommittee). Even though there is a [[congress rules committees|senate rules committee]], they do not directly affect bills in the [[senate]].
- Debate in the [[senate]] is unlimited unlike the [[house of representatives]]. This allows for [[filibuster]] tactics.

the [[senate]] is notorious for using [[riders (legislative)]].

If the House (simple majority) and the Senate (60 person majority unless a reconciliation bill is used) agrees with the bill, it gets sent to the [[US president]] for either a Presidential veto or signature.
- There is also an override function by the [[congress]] with a 2/3 majority override, but this is rare because if a [[US president]] realizes that they will be overridden, they will just pass the bill to avoid looking weak.
- [[US president]] can also use a [[pocket veto]].

When a [[US president]] signs a bill to law, the [[US president]] will write a "signing statement" as to why it is supported or beneficial. However, the [[US president]] will typically writes what he envisions the law will do, so in case the bill is sued, the [[US president]] can express his visions of the bill if the bill ever ends up in federal court, such as the [[supreme court]].
