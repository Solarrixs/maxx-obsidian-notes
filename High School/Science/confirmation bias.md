> [!NOTE] Definition
> Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.

A famous illustration of the [[confirmation bias]] is the [[Wason Card Selection Task]].

- People have a tendency to:
	- Overestimate the extent to which other people's judgement is affected by the confirmation bias
	- Denying the effect of confirmation bias on their own judgements
