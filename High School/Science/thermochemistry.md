Heat is the transfer of thermal energy usually in a chemical reaction where [[chemical bonding|chemical bonds]] are being formed and broken, measured by temperature.
- Chemical reactions are typically done in a [[florence flask]].
- Are typically divided into a system and a surrounding environment

In an open system (open flask), there will be an exchange of [[thermodynamics]] and a loss of mass due to evaporation
In an closed system (closed flask), only [[thermodynamics]] is being exchanged and remains at equilibrium
In an isolated/insulated system, nothing is being transferred

Depends on [[specific heat]]
