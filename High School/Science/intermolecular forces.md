Intermolecular forces are attraction forces between molecules.
[[intermolecular forces]] have weaker attractions than [[intramolecular forces]].

## Properties as a Result of Intermolecular Forces
Strength of the intermolecular forces determine various properties of chemicals.
- Stronger intermolecular forces = higher melting/boiling temperatures
- Like dissolves in like: polar/ionic solutes dissolve in polar solvents (by [[dipole dipole forces]]) & non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents (by [[dispersion forces]])
- Weaker intermolecular force = stronger [[vapor pressure]]
- Weaker intermolecular force = lower [[viscosity]] and [[surface tension]]

## Examples of Intermolecular Forces
- [[dipole dipole forces]]
- [[ion dipole forces]]
- [[dispersion forces]]
- [[hydrogen bond]]

## Strongest to Weakest inter/intra Molecular Force
[[network bonds]] - **solids**
[[metallic bonds]]
[[ionic bonds]]
[[covalent bonds]]
[[ion dipole forces]]
[[hydrogen bond]] - **liquids**
[[dipole dipole forces]]
[[dispersion forces]] - **gases**
