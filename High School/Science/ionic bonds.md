Ionic bonds are due to attractions between oppositely charged ions. Thus, they are mainly formed between [[metals]] and nonmetals.

Ionic substances are typically brittle, have high melting and boiling points, crystalline, and able to be cleaved into smooth flat surfaces. This is opposite of [[covalent bonds]].

[[electronegativity]] difference greater than 2.

close attractions due to the electrostatic attraction of positive and negative charges or the distance between ions.
- [[lattice energy]] is within a bond: energy required to break 1 mole of the salt into its elements in a gas phase

To determine which ion would have a stronger attraction with another molecule: check the charge of the ion and the size of the atom. Larger charge and smaller size leads to greater attraction.
