[[electron]] affinity is similar to [[electronegativity]]. This is measurable, and Cl has the highest electron affinity.

Electron affinity is the opposite of [[ionization energy]], as it is the energy required to gain an electron.

All electron affinity values are negative since energy is released (exothermic).
