Quartz is the most common mineral on [[earth]].

There are two main groups of quartz: quartz crystals and microcrystalline varieties.

Quartz is a silicate mineral, meaning that it is made up of both [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] atoms in the chemical formula $SiO_2$.

Quartz, like other minerals, can be formed through [[bowen's reaction series]].

According to the [[goldich series]], Quartz is one of the least susceptible elements to weathering due to the strength of its molecular bonds.

Quartz is also special because it has [[piezoelectric properties]]. When quartz is compressed or struck, it generates a small electric current. Also, if electrical currents are run through quartz, it's shape changes slightly. Certain clocks use this effect to measure time by applying a consistent electric current to a piece of quartz and counting the resulting number of pulses.

Quartz can come in many different forms of shapes, sizes, and colors like [[amethyst]] or [[citrine]], or even combinations of quartz variants like [[ametrine]].

The color of quartz is affected by impurities of various elements (Ti, Fe, Mg, Mn, Al).
