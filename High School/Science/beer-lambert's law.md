$A=\epsilon bc$
- Absorbance (no unit) = [[molarity|molar]] absorptivity ($M^{-1}cm^{-1}$) $\cdot$ path length (width of the cuvette in $cm$) $\cdot$ concentration ($M$)
- $\epsilon$ = molar absorptivity = constant for a type of element

Beer's law shows that absorption (A) is proportional to concentration (c). Then: $\dfrac{A_1}{A_2}=\dfrac{c_1}{c_2}$

## Steps of Spectrophotometry
a spectrophotometer to measure unknown concentrations in samples. this is only used for transition metals since they create a color when mixed, and spectrophotometers measure color output.

as solutions have distinctive colors, the solutions can absorb/transmit different wavelengths. a greater intensity indicates more concentrated solutions.

sample is placed into cuvette (handled with gloves to avoid fingerprints). multiple wavelengths of light are shot through the cuvette to determine optimal wavelength (wavelength with the highest absorbance, known as $\lambda_{max}$, then all concentrations of solution are measured with optimal wavelength.

negative control should be used. that would usually be water. this calibrates the absorbance reading to A=0.000.

the plot of absorbance and concentration is linear. increased concentration results in increased absorption.
