## Coffee Cup Calorimeter
isolated insulated region to calculate enthalpy

In an [[exothermic]] reaction, temperature of the calorimeter increases.
In an [[endothermic]] reaction, temperature of the calorimeter decreases.

## Specific Heat of Unknown Substance
If an unknown substance $A$ is dropped in a calorimeter:
$mC\Delta T_{{A}} = mC\Delta T_{{H_{2}O}}$
The final temperatures of $A$ and $H_{2}O$ will be the same.

## Formulas
Add masses for Q when:
1. Heat of Solution or Enthalpy of Solution from salt dissolving in water
2. Chemical reaction ([[neutralization reaction]]) occurring in the calorimeter
