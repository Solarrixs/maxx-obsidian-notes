$q=mH_{f}$ in $J/g$

Used during a phase change (flat line on the heating curve)
- Can determine the $H_{f}$ given grams of a solid. The $q$ will be calculated by subtracting the energy on the x-axis from the final to the initial energy needed to transform a solid to liquid

Heat of fusion is calculated for 1g of a solid
