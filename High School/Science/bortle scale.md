System to measure light pollution.
- In [[Astrophotography]], light pollution can be canceled out in post-processing gradients or using a light pollution filter, such as a IR block filter for DSLR cameras.

Populated areas like cities and suburbs correspond to a Bortle scale of 8-9 (9 being the highest).
