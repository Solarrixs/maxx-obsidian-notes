Flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star.

It is different from [[bipolar outflows]].

[[stellar classification|Different classifications of stars]] have different types of stellar winds:
- Post [[main-sequence star]] often eject large quantities of mass in massive slow winds. These include [[red-giant star]], [[Supergiant Stars]], and [[Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars]].
- Young [[T Tauri Stars]] have powerful stellar winds.
- [[G2-type Main-Sequence Star]] like the [[sun]] have their stellar wind driven by their hot, magnetized [[corona]].

Stellar wind produces a [[stellar-wind bubble]] around a star.
