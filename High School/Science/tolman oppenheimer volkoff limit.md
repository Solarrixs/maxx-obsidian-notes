This is similar to the [[chandrasekhar limit]] but for [[neutron star]].

Neutron stars are so large and compressed that the electrons and protons have combined to form neutrons, and thus the star is supported by neutron degeneracy pressure instead of [[electron degeneracy pressure]].

This limit for Neutron Stars is around 2.1 to 2.3[[Mâ˜‰]].
