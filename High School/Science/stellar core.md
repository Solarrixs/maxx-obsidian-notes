The core is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion]] of nuclei of lighter elements into heavier elements.

Throughout stages of [[stellar evolution]], the nuclei required for processes of fusion are exhausted, leading to a collapse of the core, causing it to be denser and hotter.

When the star begins to accumulate iron in the core, the star cannot generate further energy through fusion since iron nuclei are incapable of reliably generating further energy. At this point, if the core becomes dense enough, [[electron degeneracy pressure]] will play a role in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.
