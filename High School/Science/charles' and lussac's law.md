## Charles Law
constant pressure
changed volume and temperature (in K)

linear direct relationship of volume and temperature

$V \propto T$
$\frac{V}{T} = constant$
$\frac{V_1}{T_1}=\frac{V_2}{T_2}$

## Lussac's Law
constant volume
changed pressure and temperature (in K)

linear direct relationship of pressure and temperature

$P \propto T$
$\frac{P}{T} = constant$
