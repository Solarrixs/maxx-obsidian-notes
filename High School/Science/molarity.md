$M = molarity = \dfrac{moles \ of \ solute}{liter \ of \ solutions} = \dfrac{mol}{L}$

Molarity of unknown sample can be calculated using the [[beer-lambert's law]].

## Preparing a Solution of Known Concentration
1. use the molarity formula to calculate the moles of solute and convert moles to grams of solution using GFM
2. mass the grams of solute calculated and add the solute to a volumetric flask using a funnel
3. add $dH_2O$ into the flask using the funnel until it reaches the indicated line on the volumetric flask. The meniscus must be on the line itself.

> > 1. $2.16=\dfrac{mol}{0.250L} = 0.54 moles$
> > 2. $0.54 moles \times 294.20 grams = 160 grams$ (294.20 is the GFM)
