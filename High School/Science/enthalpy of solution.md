$\Delta H_{soln}$ is the heat absorbed or absorbed when a certain amount of solute dissolves in a certain amount of solvent.

When dissolving a salt, you must consider the [[lattice energy]] and [[ion dipole forces]].
- Cations close to [[oxygen]] molecules and anions close to [[hydrogen]] molecules allows a salt to stay dissolved
- When formation reactions, [[thermodynamics]] needs to be released, so it is safer to add [[acid and bases|acids]] into water to prevent an overly [[exothermic]] reaction.

$\Delta H_{soln} = \Delta H_{soln} - H_{\text{components}}$

## Formula
Convert [[molarity]] of a solution into moles.
Calculate $q=mC\Delta T$, which is the heat absorbed or released per mole.
Divide $q$ by the moles calculated.
