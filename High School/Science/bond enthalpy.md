The amount of energy required to break a bond between 2 atoms in a gaseous compound in kJ/mol.
- $\Delta H_{rxn}=\Sigma$ (Bond Energy of Bonds Broken)$- \Sigma$(Bond Energy of Bonds Formed)
- ? Is it opposite of [[lattice energy]]?

Breaking of bonds requires input of energy and is therefore **always negative** as it is endothermic.

- ? Is bond enthalpy the same as bond energy?
