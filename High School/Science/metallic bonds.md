nuclei of all metallic atoms are held together by delocalized [[electron#Valence Electrons|valence electrons]] not associated with specific atoms or bonds but spread throughout the solid.
- '' Array of positive ions immersed in a sea of delocalized [[electron#Valence Electrons|valence electrons]].
- Since the electrons are free flowing, they are good conductors of heat and electricity

the attraction between the delocalized electrons are very strong (stronger than [[ionic bonds]]) and thus forms strong bonds. This forms the solid nature of most [[metals]].
