Potential energy diagrams (energy profiles) shows the change in energy over time.
Reactions are often split into multiple steps: $A+B \rightarrow AB^{+} \rightarrow C+D$

The slow [[reaction mechanisms with elementary steps]] will have a higher peak due to a higher [[activation energy]].

$AB^+$ is called transition state. Reactant molecules are not in correct orientation, and therefore a reaction has not occurred. Highly unstable.
$E_{a}$ is the activation energy. Low activation energy = faster [[rate of reaction]].

$\Delta H$ is the heat of reaction: how much energy is released in an [[exothermic]] reaction (negative) or absorbed in an [[endothermic]] reaction (positive)
- Products - Reactants
- If $\Delta H > 0$, then it is [[endothermic]]
- If $\Delta H < 0$, then it is [[exothermic]]
