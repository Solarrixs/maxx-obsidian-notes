## Properties of Metals
has luster, high electrical/thermal conductivity, malleable, ductile, very high melting points, and mostly solid (except Mercury).
- free flowing [[electron|electrons]] (delocalized electrons or sea of electrons) make it easy to conduct heat, electricity, malleability and ductility. more valence electrons = greater ductility.
- strength of [[metallic bonds]] allow for very high melting points

## Metal Alloys
Alloys are materials that contain more than one element and has the characteristic properties of a metal. Metals can all be alloyed to modify its properties.
- [[bronze]], [[brass]] - majority of copper
- [[stainless steel]] - chromium occupy interstitial positions

### Types of Metal Alloys
[[substitutional alloys]] - between metals of similar size
[[interstitial alloys]] - between metals of different size

- substitutional and interstitial alloys are dispersed randomly and uniformly, forming solid [[homogenous mixtures]].
- intermetallic compounds are alloys of fixed compositions and definite properties
