Is a unit for speed.

Symbol: c

Equal to 299,792,458 m/s or 186,000 mi/s.

Equal to 173 [[astronomical unit|AU]] a day or 0.307 [[parsec|parsecs]] a year.

It takes about 8 minutes and 17 seconds for light from the [[sun]] to travel to [[earth]].

In computers, 1/c is the ultimate minimum communication delay.

According to the [[special theory of relativity]], c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter, energy, or any signal carrying information can travel through space.

All forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] travel at c. The speed of light will be less than c if light propagates through transparent materials (air, glass).

## Approximate Light Travel Times
- 1m - 3.3 nanoseconds
- Moon to Earth - 1.3 seconds
- Sun to Earth (1 [[astronomical unit|AU]]) - 8.3 minutes
- 1 [[parsec]] - 3.26 years
- [[proxima centauri]] - 4.2 years
