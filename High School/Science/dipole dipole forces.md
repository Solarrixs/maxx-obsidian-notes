A type of [[intermolecular forces|intermolecular force]] between polar molecules (dipoles), which have [[covalent bonds#polar covalent bonds]]. Mainly occurs in liquids.

Dipole dipole forces result in a partial negative and partial positive charge for the atoms. The atom with a greater [[electronegativity]] will be partial negative.
- A cis-isomer will have stronger bonds than a trans-isomer since the bonds do not cancel out and result in a net dipole moment.

Partial negatives attract with partial positives, known as the [[dipole dipole forces]].

Medium strength intermolecular force.
