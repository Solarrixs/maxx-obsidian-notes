Similar to [[galvanic cell]] but requires a battery, which itself is a [[galvanic cell]]. Not a spontaneous reaction and is thus thermodynamically unfavorable.

Used for producing pure elements from salts.

The negative strip is the [[cathode]] and attracts negative ions for reduction.
The positive strip is the [[anode]] and attracts positive ions for oxidation.
