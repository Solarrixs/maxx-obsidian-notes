The weakest type of [[intermolecular forces|intermolecular force]]: between non-polar molecules that cycle between states of temporary induced dipoles. The cycle of attraction and non-attraction is called [[polarizability]].
- Dispersion forces are always present whether the molecules have permanent dipoles, or not.
- The dispersion force is usually of more significance than the polarity of the molecules. However, in two molecules with the same number of electrons and similar size, the polarity becomes significant.

Mainly occurs in gases like [[noble gases]] and [[elemental gases]].
