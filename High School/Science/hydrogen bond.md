A type of [[intermolecular forces]] and an extreme type of [[dipole dipole forces]] between a hydrogen atom with a polar N-H, O-H, or F-H bond. It is stronger than regular dipole dipole force.
- This is due to the high [[electronegativity]] of N, O, and F.
- Hydrogen bonds will occur between a partial negative N, O, or F and a partial positive H.

Hydrogen bonds is the reason why water has high boiling point.
- Any molecule with a hydrogen bond can dissolve in water.

Only happens between 2 molecules and not within a molecule.

Hydrogen atoms at the end of hydroxyl $(-OH)$ groups are the most likely to dissociate.
