> > Given LiF (which is soluble since Li is group one ion), known that the base is $LiOH$ and the acid is $HF$. Since $LiOH$ contains a group one metal (it could also be a group two metal), it is a strong base and thus completely dissociate. HF is not a strong acid, so it dissociates minimally.
> > - In a solution, there will be: $Li^{+}, F^{-}, HF, OH$. The $Li^{+}$ will combine with $F^{-}$ to form $LiF$.
> > - There will be a lot of $Li$ and $OH$, less $HF$, and even less $F$. Therefore, $LiF$ will be little since $F$ can be viewed as a limiting reagent.
> > - Since $Li$ is a strong base, the $LiF$ salt is basic. The solution in general is basic because of the excess of $OH^{-}$.

> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > Given $CuCl_{2}$, know that the base is $CuOH_{2}$ and the acid is $HCl$. The acid is a strong acid while the $CuOH_{2}$ is a weak base.
> > - $HCl$ will turn into $H_3O^+$ (the $H^{+}$ will combine with $H_{2}O$) and $Cl^{-}$. The $CuCl_{2}$ will mostly stay together.
> > - There is no $OH^{-}$ in excess. Since there is an excess of $H_{3}O^{+}$, it is an acidic solution.
