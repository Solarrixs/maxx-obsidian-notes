## [[electronegativity]]
- [[noble gases]] has 0
- Cs and Fr has the least among [[metals]]
- N, O, F has the highest (resulting in the possible formation of [[hydrogen bond]])

## [[electron#Valence Electrons|valence electrons]]
- [[hydrogen]] is -1 with a [[metals|metal]] but +1 with a non-metal
- Group 1 (1); Group 2 (2); Group 3 (3); Group 14 (4); Group 15(5); Group 16 (6); Group 17 (7); Group 18 (8).
- Period 3 and above can form expanded octets due to the d orbital (even if there aren't any valence electrons in the d orbital)
- Scandium (21) has the first d orbital
- Cerium (58) has the first f orbital

## Ionization Energy
- [[noble gases]] have the highest ionization energy due to a full octet of [[electron|electrons]].

## [[radioactivity]]
- Technetium (43)
- Promethium (61)
- Polonium (84) to Oganesson (118)

## [[metals]] Vs Non-metals
- Metals make cations
- Non-metals make anions
- Metal + Metal = [[metallic bonds]]
- Non-metal + Non-metal = [[covalent bonds#nonpolar covalent bonds|nonpolar covalent bonds]]
- Metal + Non-metal = [[ionic bonds]] or [[covalent bonds#polar covalent bonds|polar covalent bonds]]

## [[diatomic elements]]
- H
- Inverse L shape of elements at F

## Unsorted Trends
- carbon always makes 4 bonds
- aluminum & boron typically form [[ionic bonds]] but form [[covalent bonds]] with [[halogen|halogens]]
- boron does not need full octets
- Be + H forms [[covalent bonds]] with an incomplete octet
- C + H forms [[covalent bonds#nonpolar covalent bonds|nonpolar covalent bonds]]
- [[halogen|halogens]] only forms single bonds
- Br and Hg are the only liquids
