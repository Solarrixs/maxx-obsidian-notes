Caused by a deficiency of [[vitamin B1]] (thiamine), which can be a result of:
1. Alcohol abuse
2. Dietary deficiencies
3. Prolonged vomiting
4. Eating disorders
5. Chemotherapy

Symptoms:
1. Delirium, then confabulation (unrestrained talking)
2. Gait disorder
3. Problems with memory and disorientation (called [[wernicke's]] encephalopathy. If occurring simultaneously with alcoholic korsakoff's syndrome, it is known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome)

Long term problems:
1. Memory problems
2. Difficulty learning and retaining new information
3. Difficulty recalling memories from the recent past

Treated with thiamine supplementation, which can lead to complete resolution, especially when alcohol misuse is not he underlying cause.

Incidence of Korsakoff's syndrome has dropped significantly due to [[food fortification]] of [[vitamin B1]] in cereals and bread.
