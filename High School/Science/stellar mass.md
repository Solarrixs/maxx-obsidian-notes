Used to describe the mass of a [[star]].

Usually uses the unit [[M☉]], which a proportion of the [[sun|Sun's]] mass.

A star's stellar mass will vary over its lifetime due to:
1. [[stellar wind]]
2. [[stellar pulsation behavior]]
3. [[stellar accretion]]

Stars are also grouped by their stellar mass.
1. Very low mass stars (mass below 0.5 M☉) do not enter the [[Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars]] phase but evolve directly into [[white dwarf|white dwarfs]].
2. Low mass stars (mass below 1.8-2.2 M☉) do enter into the [[Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars]] and develop a degenerate helium core.
3. Intermediate mass stars undergo [[Helium Fusion]] and develop a degenerate [[carbon-oxygen star core]].
4. Massive stars (mass from 5-10 M☉) undergo [[carbon fusion]] and end their lives through the [[gravitational collapse]] of the core, leading to a [[Supernova]] explosion. [[black holes]] may be created as a result [[black holes]].
