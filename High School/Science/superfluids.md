Superfluids usually form near 0 Kelvin, where particles have essentially no kinetic energy and have 0 [[viscosity]]. As the particles are in their lowest energy state, not even gravity nor friction can remove energy from it. This means there the fluid has no internal friction.

Having 0 viscosity, superfluids can flow forever and up walls of their container. It also has 0 [[entropy]].

The superfluid state is its own state of matter, known as the [[bose einstein condensate]], as the particles begin behaving like [[boson|bosons]].

Superfluids may make up the cores of [[neutron star]].

Examples of Superfluids:
1. [[helium-3,4]]
