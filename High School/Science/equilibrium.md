A chemical equilibrium is a state in which there are no observable changes in the concentrations of reactants and products as time goes by. Therefore, the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal.
- Every equilibrium equation has an [[equilibrium constant]].

Equilibrium calculations can only be done with $(aq)$ or $(g)$ reactants. Do not include $(s) \text{ or } (l)$ reactants.
- Can use [[hess's law]] for equilibrium calculations, but slightly different rules: doubling or halving the reactions lead to a change in the exponent of an $K_{c}$ value while reversing the equation will lead to the inverse of the $K_{c}$ value to $\frac{1}{K_{c}}$

A physical equilibrium are phase changes (any reaction is reversible).
- Not all reactions are reversible. If a product becomes a liquid or solid, the reaction goes to completion (but an aqueous solution or a gaseous product can be reversible)
