Stellar Evolution is the process by which a star changes over the course of time → depends on the mass of the star.

Bigger stars have shorter lives, and vice versa.

All stars are first formed through the [[gravitational collapse|gravitational collapse]] of [[Nebula|nebulae]] or [[Molecular Clouds|molecular clouds]] → [[protostars]], which eventually settle into a state of equilibrium as [[main-sequence star]].

Energy is initially generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms of a [[main-sequence star|main sequence star]] → [[hydrogen fusion]].

In its later life, the dominant element within the star’s core becomes helium, and the star begins to fuse hydrogen along a shell surrounding the core → causes the growth of [[main-sequence star]] (see: [[red-dwarf star]]) into [[subgiant stars]] and then [[red-giant star]].
	- Must be greater than ½ of the mass of the [[sun]].
	- More massive stars than the [[sun]] can fuse heavier elements (see: [[carbon burning process]], [[oxygen burning process]]…) [[stellar nucleosynthesis#Key Reactions of Stellar Nucleosynthesis]]

Stars that have exhausted its nuclear fuel has its core collapse into a [[white dwarf]] while the outer layers are expelled as [[planetary nebula]].

Stars that are 10 times the mass of the [[sun]], having an inert iron core, can explode into a [[supernova]], resulting in [[neutron star]] or [[black holes]].
