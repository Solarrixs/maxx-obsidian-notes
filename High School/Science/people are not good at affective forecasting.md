People constantly forecast future events, but most people are not too good at it. We overestimate the impact of decision outcomes and life events in both positive and negative situations. This, in part, is influenced by the effect of [[loss aversion]].

For example, we tend to think that winning the lottery will make us happier than it actually will, or that life would be unlivable if we lost the function of our legs or arms.

This is true for trivial events - going to a great restaurant vs. going to a crappy restaurant.
This is true for major events as well - losing a job or a kidney.
