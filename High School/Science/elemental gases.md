The [[diatomic elements]] $H_2$, $N_2$, $F_2$, $Cl_2$ are gases.
- Other elemental gases can include [[ozone]], hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, etc.

All [[noble gases]] are also gases.

## Physical Characteristics
Assume volume and shape of their containers. As they are very far from each other, they have low [[intermolecular forces]].

Most compressible state of matter and has lower densities than liquids and solids.

Gases mix evenly and completely when confined to the same container.
