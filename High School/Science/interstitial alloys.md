mixing [[metals]] of different size metals causes the minority element's atom to occupy "holes" between solvent non-metal atoms that have much smaller bonding atomic radius.
- ex stainless steel

The [[covalent bonds]] formed causes the metal [[lattice energy]] to become harder, stronger, and less ductile.
- ex usually adding graphene or graphite
