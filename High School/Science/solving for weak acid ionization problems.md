To determine the pH of a weak acid:
1. Identify major species that affect the pH
2. Use [[ICE chart]]

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Calculate the pH of a 0.036M nitrous acid $(HNO_{2})$ solution
>
> $HNO_{2} \leftrightarrow H^+ + NO_{2}^-$
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > Initial concentration of $HNO_{2}$ is 0.036M, but will lose $-X$ concentration while $H^+$ and $NO_{2}^-$ will gain $X$.
> > Therefore, at equilibrium, the formula will be $0.036-X HNO_{2}$, $X H^+$, and $X NO_{2}^-$
> > Solve for [[solubility for acids]]: $K_{A} = \frac{[H^+][NO_{2}^-]}{[HNO_{2}]}$ = $\frac{X^2}{0.036-X}$ = $4.5 \times 10^{-4}$. Since it isn't less than $10^{-10}$, don't assume $0.036-X = 0.036$.
> > $X = 0.0038M$
