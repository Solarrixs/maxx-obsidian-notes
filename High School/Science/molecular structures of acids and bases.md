Weaker bonds to an acidic H will lead to a stronger [[acid (chemistry)]] because that bond is more easily broken, and thus the acid will more readily donate the H.
- Therefore, larger halogens are stronger acids (HF is weak, but HI and HBr is strong)

Acid strength increases from left to right and increases down a group.

Molecules with high [[electronegativity]] will lead to an easier breakage of a [[hydrogen bond]], and therefore it will become a stronger acid.
