Is a quantum-mechanical effect from the [[pauli exclusion principle]].

As [[electron]] are [[fermions]], no 2 electrons can be in the same state, and thus electrons occupy a range of energy levels (band of energy levels).

So if you compress an electron gas, it will increase the number of electrons in the given volume, and thus raise the maximum energy level in an occupied band. Then, the energy of electrons increases upon compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas in order to compress it, which produces the [[electron degeneracy pressure]] effect.
