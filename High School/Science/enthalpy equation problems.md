## Examples
> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> Write the heat of formation equation for ${Al_{2}O_{3}}_{(s)}$?
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > Since a compound is given, then ${Al_{2}O_{3}}_{(s)}$ is the product and is given in 1 mole.
> > $2Al_{s} + 1.5O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 1Al_{2}O_{3(g)}$

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> Write the heat of formation equation for $H_{2}SO_{4(l)}$?
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > $H_{2(g)} + S_{(s)} + 2O_{2(g)} \rightarrow H_{2}SO_{4(l)}$

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> $2Al_{(s)} + 1.5O_{2(g)} \rightarrow Al_{2}O_{3(s)}$
> What is the amount of energy liberated by the oxidation of 6.75g of Al if the $\Delta H_{f}$ of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ is -1669.4
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > Notice that $H_{f} = H_{rxn}$ because it is a heat of formation reaction, then $\Delta H_{rxn} = \Delta H_{f}=-1669.4$
> > $\frac{6.75\text{g of Al}}{2 \times 26.98\text{g of Al}} \times -1669.4kJ = 209kJ \text{ liberated}$

> When 1g of methane is burned, 55.6kJ of heat is evolved (released). What is the $\Delta H_{combustion}$ for the combustion of one mole of methane?
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > $1 \text{ mol of }CH_{4} \times 16.04g \text{ of } CH_{4} \times 55.6kJ = 892kJ$ released

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> The $\Delta H_{f}$ for $CCl_{4}$ is -131.8kJ/mol. What is the $\Delta H_{rxn}$ for the following reaction:
> $CH_{4} + 2Cl_{2} \rightarrow CCl_{4} + 2H_{2}$
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > $\Delta H_{rxn} = -131.8 - (-74.8) = -57kJ$

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> What is the $\Delta H_{rxn}$ for $CH_{4}+ 3Cl_{2} \rightarrow CHCl_{3} + 3HCl$ if the $\Delta H_{f}$ for $CHCl_{3}$ is -131.8kJ/mol?
>
> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > $\Delta H_{rxn} = -74.8-(-131.8+3(-92.3)) = -333.9kJ$
