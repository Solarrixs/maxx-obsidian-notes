MAPKs are diverse signaling cassettes that signal cellular responses like proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, transcription factor regulation, phosphorylation, and protein scaffolding. [[ERK]] 1 and 2, [[JNK]], and [[p38]] are all MAPK stress kinases. Thus, MAPKs are distinct in that they have the capacity to respond to a variety of stimuli and transmit a diverse array of intraand extracellular signals.
