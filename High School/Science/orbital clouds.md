Orbitals are regions in which an [[electron]] have the greatest probability of being found.

Each orbital are assigned their own quantum number of integers (sub-level) in conjunction with either the letters s, p, d, or f. The [[pauli exclusion principle]] is based on this fact.

The maximum number of electrons an orbital can hold is 2. 

The S sub-level has 1 orbitals that can hold 2 electrons.
The P sub-level has 3 orbitals that can hold 6 electrons.
The D sub-level has 5 orbitals that can hold 10 electrons.
The F sub-level has 7 orbitals that can hold 14 electrons.

The first d orbital occurs in Scandium 
The first f orbital occurs in Cerium
