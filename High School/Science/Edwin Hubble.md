Edwin Hubble first began his astronomy career at the Mount Wilson Observatory.

Hubble is best known for the space telescope that shares his name, the [[hubble space telescope]].

Hubble's Law states that a relationship between an object’s distance from us and the speed at which it is receding from us. Hubble and his colleague Milton Humason attempted to calculate the rate of this recession using stars’ redshift.

Hubble used the variations of brightness in particular stars found by Henrietta Leavitt to determine the distance of [[cepheid variable]] stars.

Hubble also discovered that the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was not far enough to be a separate star system, and is thus the first evidence that the [[Milky Way]] wasn't the only [[galaxies|galaxy]] in the universe.

Hubble also created the tuning fork diagram, which is a classification system for [[galaxies]].
