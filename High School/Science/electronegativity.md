Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract [[electron|electrons]] toward itself in a chemical bond.

This is relative, and has no units, but [[electron affinity]] is measurable.

Fluorine has the greatest electronegativity of 4.00, while Cesium and Francium has the least electronegativity value. However, noble gases has no electronegativity since they have a full octet.

Elements closer to fluorine have a greater electronegativity value.

[[electron|electrons]] are pulled towards a more electronegative element if the atoms of the elements are in a [[covalent bonds#polar covalent bonds]]. This causes the more electronegative to have a partial negative charge while the less electronegative elements will have a partial positive charge.
