The Solar Wind is a stream of charged [[plasma]] particles that flow outwards from the [[sun|sun's]] upper atmosphere ([[corona]]).
- The plasma usually consists of [[electron]], [[protons]], and [[alpha particles]].
- The particles can escape the Sun's [[gravity]] because of their high kinetic energy due to the high temperature of the corona.

In other stars besides the Sun, it is known as [[stellar wind]].

The Solar Wind creates a bubble region of the [[heliosphere]] in the [[solar system]].

When solar wind impacts [[earth|earth's]] atmosphere, it leads to the [[aurora lights]].

Solar wind also ensures that the plasma tails of [[comets]] always point away from the Sun.

Solar wind stretches far beyond [[pluto]] until it encounters termination shock, where motion slows abruptly due to the pressure of the interstellar medium.
