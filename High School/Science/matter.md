Matter - something with volume and mass
- Elements: pure and simplest substances, since one type of atom, cannot be decomposed. Definite proportions. Monatomic or diatomic.
- Compounds: 2+ elements chemically combined in a ratio. Can be decomposed by chemical means. Different properties compared to constituent components.
- Mixtures: varying proportions. can be physically separated. Same properties as constituent components.
	- [[homogenous mixtures]]: substances are dissolvable/soluble. If water is used as solvent, you need to use subscript (aq)
	- [[heterogeneous mixtures]]: substances are not dissolvable/insoluble

Solubility/miscibility is determined by [[intermolecular forces]].

## Physical properties/changes
malleability luster, boiling and melting point, solubility, ductility

phase changes are physical changes

easily reversible: phase changes, dissolving with no bubbling, mild color change

## Chemical properties/changes
flammability, reactivity

something new being made (drastic color change), dissolving with violent/rapid bubbling, cannot be reversible (goes to completion)
- ex combustion and decomposition
