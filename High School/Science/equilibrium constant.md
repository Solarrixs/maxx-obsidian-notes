Written as $K$ in terms of [[molarity]] concentration $(K_{c})$ or [[dalton's law of partial pressures|partial pressures]] $(K_{p})$ or [[solubility product constant]] ($K_{sp}$)
- If one of them is constant, then the reaction is in equilibrium (concentration of reactants do not have to be equal to the concentration of products!)
- $K_{c} \neq K_{p}$ for the same equilibrium reaction
- $K_{p} = K_{c}(RT)^{\Delta n}$
- size of $K$ will change at different temperatures
- $K$ has no unit

The value of $K$ can determine the equilibrium state:
- $K \gg 1$, equilibrium lies to the right and favor products (more products than reactants)
- $K \ll 1$, equilibrium lies to the left and favor reactants (more reactants than products)
- $K = 1$, equilibrium is neutral and balanced

Tells us the what the [[molarity]] concentration for the reactants and the products will be at [[equilibrium]]

## Calculation
Given: $aA + bB \leftrightarrow cC + dD$

$$
K_{c} = \dfrac{{[C]^c[D]^d}}{[A]^a[B]^b}
$$
