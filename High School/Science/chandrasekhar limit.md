Chandrasekhar limit is set at a value when the mass at which the pressure from the [[electron degeneracy pressure|degeneration of electrons]] is not able to balance the self-attraction of the gravitational field.

Currently, the limit is 1.39 M☉.

If a [[white dwarf]] exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, they under gravitational collapse and turn into a [[neutron star|neutron star]] or a [[black holes|black hole]].

Otherwise, [[white dwarf]] with a mass under the Chandrasekhar limit will remain as a stable white dwarf.

The significance of the Chandrasekhar limit is that it is accepted to be 1.4 times the mass of the [[sun]] such that if the white dwarf is within the limit they stay as such forever whereas the star that exceeds the limit will experience explosions turning into a supernova.
