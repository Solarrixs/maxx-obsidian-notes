An atom's formal charge is the difference between the number of valence [[electron|electrons]] and the number of [[electron|electrons]] assigned to that atom in a [[lewis dot diagram]].
- Valence Electrons - # of Electrons - # of Bonds (or ${\frac{1}{2}}$ the number of electrons in a bond)

A typical molecule has 0 charges, so the sum of the formal charge should equal to 0. The molecule with multiple configurations with the greatest number of 0 formal charge is the correct configuration. If configurations doesn't have a 0 formal charge, then the model with an [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element that has a negative formula charge is the correct model.
