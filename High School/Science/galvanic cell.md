Spontaneous (thermodynamically favorable) [[redox reactions]] without a battery.
- Since galvanic cell is favorable, then $\Delta G < 1$ and $K > 1$

Metal plates known as [[electrodes]] are put into beakers.

Voltage is $+E^0$ or $E^0 > 0$.
- $E^0 = E^{0} \text{ cathode} - E^0 \text{ anode}$
$-\Delta G^0 < 0$ or $\Delta G^0 = -nFE^0$

[[redox half-reactions]] will occur for the ions in both beakers.

The more negative voltage is the [[anode]] (oxidation) while the more positive voltage is the [[cathode]] (reduction)

Electricity only flows from anode to cathode.

Positive ion flows into the reduction beaker (towards the cathode). Thus, anode metal gets smaller and cathode metal gets larger in size.
