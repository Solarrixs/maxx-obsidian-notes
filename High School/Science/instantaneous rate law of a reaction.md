Relationship of the [[rate of reaction]] to the rate constant and the concentrations of reactants raised to a power.
- Only reactants, ignore products!

Are all experimentation data.

Rate = $k[A]^x[B]^y$
- $k$ - rate constant (how fast a reaction is happening) - changes with temperature or catalyst activity ($M^{(x+y-1)}s^{-1}$). Does not depend on concentration, and does not have to be in seconds. $k = \frac{\text{Rate}}{[A]^x[B]^y}$
- $[A],[B]$ - initial concentration of A and B reactants in [[molarity]]
- $x, y$ - rate orders with respect to A and B reactants (the speed at which A or B is depleting in concentration). The sum of $x$ and $y$ is the overall rate reaction.
- Rate = $M/unit~of~time$

Fast reactions have a k value above $10^9$. Slow reactions have a k value below $10$

Rate reactions results in a square change of magnitude.
- ex If $[A]$ is a first order reaction, and you triple the concentration of $[A]$ in the 2nd experiment compared to the 1st experiment, then the reaction rate also triples.
- ex If If $[A]$ is a second order reaction, and you double the concentration of $[A]$ in the 2nd experiment compared to the 1st experiment, then the reaction rate quadruples.

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> The rate law for $2A + B \rightarrow C + 2D$ is first order in A and second order for B. If the rate constant at $25\degree C$ is $3.0 \times 10^2s^{-1}$, determine the [[rate of reaction]] when the concentration of A is 0.50M and the concentration of B is 0.10M.
