The aperture is the diameter of the opening at the front of a camera or telescope where light enters.

It is calibrated in f/stops.
- Lower f/stops give more exposure, less depth of field, and a faster shutter speed
- Higher f/stops give less exposure, greater depth of field, and a slower shutter speed

In [[Astrophotography]] the aperture is fixed.
