When chemical [[homogenous mixtures|solutions]] are being tested for thermal [[thermodynamics]] transfer or is being heated, it is usually done in a florence flask.

Distributes heat evenly to a solution that is being heated, so one part of the solution doesn't heat up faster than the other and cause an explosion.
