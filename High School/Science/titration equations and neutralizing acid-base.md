Titration determines an unknown concentration of acid or base until it reaches an [[equivalence point]] by adding a known concentration of either acid or base in a buret. The [[pH indictators|pH indictator]] can determine the equivalence point. This is essentially a [[neutralization reaction]].

Titration Equations go to completion if:
- moles of $H^+$ = moles of $OH^-$
- ($H^+$)MV = ($OH^-$)MV
- solid (solubility guidelines), liquid (water), or gas is created

Acid + Base â†’ Water + Salt

See: [[titration curve]]

> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > 1. Find the moles and create the equation: $CH_{3}COOH + OH^- \rightarrow CH_{3}COO^- + H_{2}O$
> > 2. Since all moles will be used up, there will be $0.0025$ moles of $CH_{3}COO^-$, which will undergo an equilibrium equation with $H_{2}O$ to generate the equation $CH_{3}COO^- + H_{2}O \rightarrow CH_{3}COOH + OH^-$
> > 3. Use $K_{b} = \frac{[CH_{3}COOH][OH^-]}{[CH_{3}COO^-] \times [0.050L]}$
> > 4. Solve: $5.6 \times 10^{-10} = \dfrac{x^2}{0.050}$
> > 5. $x = 5.27 \times 10^{-6}M$, so use $pH = 14 - (-\log (5.27 \times 10^{-6})) = 8.7$
