The presence of a common ion decreases the solubility of the salt (by increasing its concentrations).

$NaOH \leftrightarrow Na^+ + OH^-$
$NaCl \leftrightarrow Na^+ + Cl^-$
Since these ions both require $Na^+$, then adding $NaCl$ into the solution will cause the reaction to shift to the left due to the addition of $Na^+$, a stress factor. This will cause $NaOH$ to precipitate.

A forward reaction is called dissolution
A reverse reaction is called crystallization

The system is usually dissolved in water

If the rate of dissolution equals the rate of crystallization, then it is considered a saturated [[homogenous mixtures|solutions]]

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> Given that $CaF_{2} \leftrightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2F^-$ and the $K_{sp}$ value for $CaF_{2}$ is $3.9 \times 10^{-11}$
> What is the solubility of a 0.010M of $CaF_{2}$?

> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > Since $CaCl_{2}$ is soluble, you know that there must be 0.010M of $Ca^{2+}$ and 0.020M of $2Cl^-$.
> > Write the dissociation formula for Calcium Nitrate: $CaF_{2} \leftrightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2F_{2}^-$
> > Setup an [[ICE chart]] table to get (0.010+X) for $Ca^{2+}$ and (2x) for $F_{2}^-$
> > Solve for $K_{sp} = [Ca^{2+}][F_{2}^-] \to 3.9 \times 10^{-11} = (0.010)(4x^2)$. The X value for $Ca^{2+}$ is very soluble, and therefore the change in calcium is extremely small, so assume it is just 0.
> > Solve for x to get $3.1 \times 10^{-5}M$. Thus, the molar solubility of $CaF_{2} \text{ is } 3.1 \times 10^{-5}M$
