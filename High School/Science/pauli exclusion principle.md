no two [[electron|electrons]] can have the same quantum state (number, spin). 
- ex If 2 electrons have the same orbital number, they must have opposite quantum spin, so electrons have $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$ spin projections.

However, [[boson|bosons]] are not subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. 

This was created by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1925
