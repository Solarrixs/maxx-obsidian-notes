Enthalpy $(H)$ quantifies the heat flow in or out of a system at a constant pressure

$1 H_{2}O(s) \rightarrow 1 H_{2}O(l)$ has a $\Delta H = 6.01kJ/mol$
- For 1 mole of ice that melts at $0 \textdegree C$ and 1 atm
- Known as the heat of fusion of ice

There are 5 ways to calculate enthalpy $\Delta H$
1. [[hess's law]]
2. [[bond enthalpy]]
3. $H_{products} - H_{\text{reactants}} = \Delta H$ on a [[potential energy diagrams]]
4. Calculating $\Delta H$ based on stoichiometry and coefficients: [[thermochemical equation problems]]
