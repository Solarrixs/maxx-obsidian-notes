## One Gas at Different Temperatures
![[maxwell distribution of gas speeds at different temperatures.png|700]]
- '' The speed at which the largest numbers of molecules are moving at
- Each peak represents the most probable speed of that gas at that temperature ($\mu_{mp}$)
- As temperature increases, there is a greater distribution of gas molecules traveling at higher molecular speeds

## Different Gases at Same Temperature

- '' The smaller the molar mass of the molecule, the greater distribution of greater molecular speed

## Root Mean Speed
$\mu_{rms}$ is the speed of a molecule possessing a kinetic energy identical to the average kinetic energy of the sample.

$\mu_{rms} = \sqrt{\dfrac{3RT}{M}}$ in $m/s$
- R = 8.314 J/mol K
- M = kg/mol (divide GFM by 1000)
