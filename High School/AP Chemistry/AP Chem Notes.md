## Ionization Energy
Is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom.
The outermost electron in Ca is at the 4s energy level, while Mg is at the 3s level. Therefore, the outermost electron in Ca is at a higher energy level, and i thus further away from the nucleus and is more shielded, so it is easier to remove.

Calcium has 2 electrons in its outer shell, so the first and second ionization energy would be similar since both electrons are removed from the same energy level. However, the 3rd ionization energy requires removing electron from a lower energy level, so it will require a greater ionization energy since it is closer to the nucleus.

If a subshell is completed, it is extremely hard to remove an electron from it, so the ionization energy will be a lot.

Less ionization energy to remove an electron, the more kinetic energy an electron will have.

## PES Peak Heights
Heights of peaks on PES represent the number of electrons in each subshell (subshells are like 1s, 2s, 2p). Since 1s 2s 2p subshells only hold 2 electrons, the peaks would be the same height.

Each subshell has their own peak.
Height of peaks depend on electrons in subshell.

Each energy level will have a discrete area of ionization energy.

## Electronegativity Explanation
An element has higher electronegativity if an the overall atom is smaller, then the electrons are more attracted to the nucleus of the atom compared to another atom.

Electronegativity increases as atomic radius decreases.
Electronegativity increases as an energy level comes close to being full.

## Orbital Vs Subshell Vs Shell
1, 2, 3, 4 is the shell or energy level
Subshell is like 1s, 2s, 2p, 3d, 4f
Orbitals depend on the subshell. S has 1, P has 3, D has 5, F has 7.
Electron capacity is multiplying the orbital by 2.

Valence electrons are always removed first. So even if it $4s^2 3d^{10}$, taking 2 electrons away will make it $3d^{10}$.

## Bond Length
In resonance structures, bong lengths and strength are the same. Use bond order calculation to compare the length and strength.

Bond length are achieved when the energy of interaction between the atoms is at its minimum value (PES diagram - balance of attraction and repulsion forces)

## Strength of IMF
For London dispersion force, greater electrons means greater bond strength. Thus, there is a correlation between molar mass of a molecule and the strength of the LDF.
- More electrons means greater polarizable electron cloud (polarizability).

Temperature and vapor pressure are proportional.

Deviation from ideal gas law = low temp, high pressure, or high IMF strength

No IMFs in ideal gases

## Random Facts
In paper chromatography, distance the ink travels along paper is measured via the retention factor ($R_{f} = \frac{\text{solute distance}}{\text{solvent front distance}}$).
- nonpolar solvent = nonpolar substance travels furthest, and vice versa

In chromatography column eluted with polar substance, then polar molecule will leave the column first

Higher $R_{f}$ = weaker IMF molecule.

Molar mass = Density $\times$ $R$ $\times$ $T$ / $P$

Always add water, then acid!

Pure water is not a good conductor of water because it is a covalent structure. Tap water is conductive because of dissolved ions in it

Boron only requires 6 electrons to be stable.

Period 3 elements can have expanded octets.

Hybridization doesn't change based on number of bonds. For example, a double bond is still counted as one.

Square planar molecules (4 atoms bonded and 2 lone pairs on the central atom) are nonpolar.

BARF - break = absorb ($+\Delta H$) and form = release ($-\Delta H$)

Heat of Solution: solute-solute ($+\Delta H$) + solvent-solvent ($+\Delta H$) + solute-solvent ($-\Delta H$), remember that $-\Delta H$ increases heat.

Tetrahedral shape is 109.5!

Stirring only increases rate of reaction in heterozygous solutions

Container with highest pressure is gas with least GFM because it has greatest moles. However, density is the same if mass and volume is the same

For melting points of ionic compounds, account for charge and size of ions

Large noble gases can create bonds with very electronegative elements (typically F)

Formation of ion dipole attraction is exothermic when dissolving something in a solution

water is always neutral, auto ionization of water is endothermic

H has positive dipole in anything but water

Combustion equations are not reversible

Atom's magnetic moment increases with # of unpaired electrons

## Electromagnetic Spectrum
$E = hf$ and $c=\lambda f$

Typically $\lambda$ is given in meters, so multiply by $1*10^{-9}$

Intensity of light doesn't affect $f \text{ or } \lambda$

## Dilution for Spectrophotometry
When calculating concentrations of something in multiple samples for spectrophotometry, first get the number of moles from the volume used to create the sample. Then divide the moles by the NEW total volume.

## Combustion
When counting moles of $H_{2}O$, make sure to double the moles of $H$ in the end.

Always make sure the hydrocarbon is set as 1 mole in case you do enthalpy calculations later

## Spectator Ions & Net Ionic Equations
Spectator ions are the same on both sides of the equation.

When determining which species are present after the reactions occur, pay attention to the subscript of elements!

## Reduction Potential
If an ion was able to reduce to a solid metal by taking electrons from another metal strip X, then the ion must have a reduction potential (the ability to gain electrons)

## Kinetics
To increase rate of reaction, you need to reduce half life

If there is an intermediate in the slow step, and the previous step is in equilibrium, substitute the intermediate product for the reactants in the previous step

If in an experiment both A and B is doubled and it results in 4x rate, and you also know B results in a 2x rate, then A must be at a 2x rate

Constant half life = 1st order reaction!!

Temperature affects half life because faster reaction

Rate law is never affected by temperature

## Calorimetry
If you dissolve a solid in a liquid, add the mass of the solid to the liquid

If density is not 1.00, you need to multiply density by the solution volume to get the mass

Heat of formation or vaporization is based on 1 mol only! So you need to remember to divide by 2 if it's given as 2 moles like $2HF$.

hydration energy is $-\Delta H$ and lattice energy is $+\Delta H$ for $\Delta H_{soln}$. Hydration energy like lattice energy is based on Coulomb's law, which accounts for size and charge.

If a metal loses heat and the water gains heat in calorimetry, the change in heat is the same. So you can use $q=mC\Delta T$ 2 times and solve for each other.

## Equilibrium
Similar to Hess's law but slight changes. Flipping = reciprocal. Multiplying equation = squaring equilibrium.

If you have $Ag_{2}CO_{3}$ it will dissociate to become $2Ag + CO_{3}$. Note the coefficient of $Ag$!

If $K_{sp}$ of $AgCl$ is $1.8 \times 10^{-10}$, the solubility of $AgCl$ is $K_{sp} = [Ag][Cl] = x^2$

To form precipitate, $Q > K_{sp}$

Equilibrium constant is ONLY changed by temperature

If solution evaporates, then more precipitate will form because beaker will become oversaturated with ions and need to fall out of the solution to remain in equilibrium

Molar solubility: if given $Na_{3}PO_{4}$, then it dissociating gives 3 $Na$, so there is $\frac{1}{3}$ of $Na_{3}PO_{4}$ compared to $Na$
- Also, given $K_{sp}$, find molar solubility by finding $x$ from the equilibrium equation.

## Acid and Base
Net ionic for strong base and acid is just $H+OH \leftrightarrow H_{2}O$

Higher temp = lower pH of water

Equivalence point is when moles of acid = moles of base, no matter if it is a weak or strong base/acid

Buffer is always acid + conjugate base

Best buffer is if the $pKa = pH$
- If $pH > pKa$, then there is more conjugate base than original acid.

Adding water to weak acid will increase percent ionization because there will be less concentration

Dilution of buffer does nothing to $pH$

Percent dissociation = concentration of conjugates created/original concentration of acid

## Thermodynamics
$+\Delta G = -K$ and vice versa ($-K$ means to favor reactants)

Oxidation potential + reduction potential. Never multiply the potential for a half reaction by a coefficient

Whatever has higher standard reduction potential is the thing being reduced. Then flip the other equation to get the equation for it being oxidized.

Changing concentrations of solutions in galvanic cell will affect $Q$ calculation. If Q decreases, cell potential increase and vice versa.

Salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality in the cell and keeps the voltage of the cell preventing it from dropping to 0 by transferring ions
- typically $KNO_{3}$ or $NaNO_{3}$

Nernst Equation: $E_{\text{cell}}=E^o_{\text{cell}}-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q$

Ecell = Ered + Eox

-Eox = Ered

Electroplating steps:
1. $I=\frac{q}{t}$
2. Moles of electrons = q/96500
3. Figure out how many moles of metals are plated out for x moles of electrons
4. Turn moles of metal into grams of metal

$\frac{It}{nF}$ = moles of metal

$K_{eq} = e^{\dfrac{-\Delta G}{RT}}$

closer a cell to equilibrium, lower voltage. K is typically always very large.
- adding water will affect Q (write a numerator/denominator, one will be squared, check what will be more affected). If Q gets bigger, then the reaction is closer to equilibrium and lowering voltage.
