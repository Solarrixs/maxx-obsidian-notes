Demand schedules can be plotted to see the effect of price on demand, which generates the [[law of demand (economics)]]
- Demand (Q) should be plotted on the x-axis
- Price (P) should be plotted on the y-axis

## Example 1
| Price | Demand |
| ----- | -------- |
| 200   | 1m        |
| 150   | 2m        |
| 100   | 3m        |
| 50    | 4m        |
