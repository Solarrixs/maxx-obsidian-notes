Degree to which changes in price cause a [[change in demand and change in quantity demanded#change in quantity demanded|change in quantity demanded]]
- the more horizontal the [[demand curve]], the greater the elasticity of demand
- ex Price increases, the number of consumers drop significantly

> [!Example|dim]- Examples of Inelastic and Elastic Goods
> gasoline and cigarettes or other necessities are relatively inelastic
> - everyone needs gasoline even if prices increase, so quantity demand drops little
> luxury goods like new cars are relatively elastic
> - luxury goods are sensitive to price changes since they aren't necessities

If the answers to the following questions are "yes", the product is *relatively elastic*:
1. is it really expensive?
2. can the purchase be delayed?
3. does the purchase have suitable substitutes?

## Extreme Cases of Elasticity
![[extreme elasticity demand curves.png|400]]

The left graph is perfectly inelastic: as price changes, the quantity demand is constant
- ex Medical treatments
- since there are no substitutes to a product, the price of the product can increase but the quantity demand remains the same
- thus, they are **price makers**

The right graph is perfectly elastic: as price increases, the quantity demand goes to 0
- ex Commodities (a unit of product is different from another unit of product), especially farm goods or oil
- since the price is set at a level, decreasing the price does not affect quantity demand (nobody does this), but increasing the price above a set level will result in no quantity demand
- thus, they are **price takers**

## Elasticity Coefficient
$\dfrac{{\% \Delta Q}}{\% \Delta P}$ = Elasticity Coefficient

If > 1, then it is relatively elastic
If < 1, then it is relative inelastic
If = 1, then it is unit elastic

## Total Revenue Test
Multiple the price (P) by the quantity (Q) to get the total revenue

If price and total revenue increases OR price and total revenue decreases, it is inelastic demand
If price increases and the total revenue decreases OR vice versa, it is elastic demand
If price increases or decreases, the total revenue remain the same, it is an unit elastic demand
