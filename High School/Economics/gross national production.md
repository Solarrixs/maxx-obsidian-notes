[[economic indicator|Economic indicator]] that measures all final goods and services produced both inside and outside the US using US owned resources only.
- Under the [[expenditure approach to GDP]], US companies based in foreign countries would not be considered in the GDP, but under the GNP approach, the US companies utilizing US owned resources would be counted in the GNP.

However, this isn't utilized anymore. Typically, US manufacturing plants in a foreign country houses foreign workers that are sold to foreign countries. Therefore, it is not greatly beneficial to the US itself, and is no longer a favorable measure of measuring GDP.
