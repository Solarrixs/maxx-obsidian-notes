[[economic indicator|Economic indicator]] that measures [[the four major economic goals#growth|growth]] or [[production vs productivity|output/production]]: dollar amount of all final goods and services produced in a nations borders in a year.
- ex Ideal yearly growth in GDP for the US is 3% & has the largest GDP in the world
- Developed countries do not see much economic growth
- Also see: [[gross national production]] and [[net domestic product]]

Items not counted in the GDP are:
1. [[consumer and capital goods#capital goods|intermediate goods]]
2. Non production transactions (purely financial transactions, stocks, transfer payments, welfare payments like [[social security]], second-hand used sales)
3. Non market transactions (things people do by themselves instead of hiring someone else, such as yard work)
4. Underground economy or black markets (prostitution, drugs)

Foreign owned companies' production that occurs in the US are not counted in the GDP.

The national economy can be measured with GDP every quarter, calculated through the [[expenditure approach to GDP]] or [[income approach to GDP]].

If two consecutive quarters show negative growth, that is considered a recession.

## Problems with Using GDP as a Measure of an Economy's Success
1. Non-market transactions aren't counted, even though it might offer tremendous value, as people can spend the saved money to other goods
2. Leisure time, which can have serious impacts on an individual's life quality
3. Product quality, which determines the value of a product and how the improvements in production might benefit a person's life
4. Underground economy
5. Environmental degradation, which can seriously affect an individual's lives. Take China and India for example - smog kills thousands a year
6. Distribution of wealth, which can lead many people's lives to be worse than it should be

## Nominal GDP
GDP stated in the actual dollar value at the time period

To convert nominal GDP to real GDP: $\dfrac{\text{nominal GDP} \times 100}{\text{price index}}$
- This uses the [[consumer price index|CPI]]

## Real GDP
GDP stated in dollars adjusted for price changes, such as [[inflation]] or [[deflation]]
Oftentimes more useful than nominal GDP

To obtain output growth: $\dfrac{{\text{(real GDP in Year 2} - \text{real GDP in Year 1)} \times 100}}{\text{real GDP in Year 1}}$
