Endorsed by [[monetarism economic theory]]. The goal is to find velocity and then adjust the [[money supply]]. The money supply should increase 3% annually for ideal growth as PQ should match the increase in MV.

MV = PQ = nominal [[growth domestic product|GDP]] and also the [[potential GDP]].
- M = [[money supply]], most controllable
- V = velocity of money, relatively stable. Is the number of times the same dollars can be spent. Technology and electronic transfer increase the velocity
- P = average price level
- Q = quantity of goods and services produced in an economy

The MV is the buying side and the PQ side is the selling side.
- ex If MV drops below PQ, there is a [[recession]]
- ex If MV goes above PQ, there is [[inflation]]
