Classical economists did not believe in an [[aggregate supply]] curve. There only exists a long run aggregate supply line.
- Therefore, wages, prices, and [[interest rate]] are completely flexible.

The [[keynesian economic theory]] believed that the [[government]] should spend money to increase the [[aggregate demand]] to drive the economy out of a recession.
