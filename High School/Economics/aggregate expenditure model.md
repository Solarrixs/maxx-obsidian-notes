Savings is equal to [[determinants of investment demand|investment]] according to Kayes.
- This model is a closed economy. There is no [[government]] or other countries interacting with. Once the economy is open, the real national income becomes the [[growth domestic product#real GDP|real GDP]]
- Aggregate expenditure under the equilibrium line represents savings.

At the disequilibrium point (real national income is at 1200), planned investment is equal to savings.
- The unplanned investment is an excess amount of inventory that businesses don't want to have. This means a decreased in [[growth domestic product|GDP]].
- The AE line does not include unplanned investments (it is consumption + investment), but the reference AE line does include unplanned investments (it includes the real [[national income]]).

- If the equilibrium is under the [[full and under employment|full employment]] line, there is a recession and a negative [[GDP gap]], and [[aggregate expenditure]] must increase by the amount of the recessionary gap (reference line to AE line) to arrive at full employment.
- If the equilibrium is above the full employment line, there is a positive GDP gap leading to [[inflation]], and [[aggregate expenditure]] must lower by the inflation gap.

[[MPC]] or [[MPS]] is always equal to the slope of C or AE.
