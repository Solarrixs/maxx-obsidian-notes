Degree to which changes in price change the quantity supplied
- the more horizontal the supply curve, the greater the elasticity of demand

Elasticity of supply is related to the micro long run and short run:
1. Short Run: Period of time in which at least one input remains fixed (expanding inputs or locations)
2. Long Run: Period of time in which all inputs become variable
