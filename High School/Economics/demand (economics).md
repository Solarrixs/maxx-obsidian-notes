Demand is related with consumer behavior: a measure of the **willingness** and **ability** of **consumers** to buy in a given **time period**
- Want for a particular resource does not mean that products are made available to you

Demand fluctuates depending on the time
- ex The demand for Christmas trees peak before Christmas

see: [[elasticity of demand]]
alternatively, see: [[supply (economics)]]
