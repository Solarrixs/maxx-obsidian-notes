[[economic indicator]] that takes price changes into account for every component of [[growth domestic product|GDP]], and is thus considered as a dynamic price index.
- uses a personal consumption expenditure price index instead of [[consumer price index|CPI]] to calculate
- nominal GDP/real GDP * 100 = GDP Deflator

[[consumer price index|CPI]] tends to reflect price changes that correspond with GDP deflator, and yields similar results.
