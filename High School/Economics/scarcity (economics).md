unlimited [[demand (economics)]] for limited resources
- if many people want a resource that is widespread, that is a scarce resource
- if nobody wants a resource that is limited, it is not considered a scarce resource

resources do not have to be physical in nature
- ex Decisions can impact the cost of time, which is not monetary in nature but can have a huge impact on the outlook of one's life
