Used to be the most used regulation of the [[monetary policy]] by the [[federal reserve]].

US [[bonds (economic)]] and [[security]] are bought and sold to manipulate the [[money supply]] by the federal reserve to maintain their target [[federal funds rate]]. By buying US security, the federal reserve will increase the money supply in the economy. Based on the money supply graph, this will decrease [[interest rate]].
