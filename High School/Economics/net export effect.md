The borrowing by the [[government]] will force [[interest rate]] higher. This serves as a signal for investors to try and loan money with high interest rates.

Foreign investors will have to convert their money in to foreign exchange market - which places upward pressure on the price of that country's currency, strengthening it. This will make their exports appear more expensive and pull [[aggregate demand]] back, minimizing the desired [[fiscal policy#Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary fiscal policy action]].

The foreign exchange market will see an increase in demand.
