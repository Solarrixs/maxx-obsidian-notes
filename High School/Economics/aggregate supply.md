The real domestic output all firms will produce at all price levels. This is similar to reference line in the [[aggregate expenditure model]].

Different from a [[supply (economics)]] because it models the entire economy instead of a single product.

## Short Run Aggregate Supply
- Can have 3 distinct changes in slope. The stages are exaggerated but are useful to make certain points regarding what is occurring in the economy.

- Also split between the horizontal (Keynesian) range, intermediate range, and the vertical (classical) range.
	- Keynesian range: indicative of a recession. Many resources available due to high unemployment, so no price pressure. This is due to [[sticky prices (economics)]]
	- Intermediate range: pressure on prices begins to build up because of [[scarcity (economics)]] of resources. [[full and under employment|full employment]] is reached here ([[natural rate of unemployment]] and reaching [[potential GDP]]).
	- Vertical range: Output reaches max capacity. Prices increases easily but output can't increase because resources are extremely scarce. Operating under the [[natural rate of unemployment]].

## Long Run Aggregate Supply

The LRAS indicates what an economy is capable of producing if all of its resources are being used as efficiently as possible. This highlights the [[potential GDP]] and [[full and under employment|full employment]] at the intersection of AS and AD.

Determinants include productivity or new resources.

The LRAS can generate a permanent increase in expanding the economy, as the SRAS will always correct back to the equilibrium.
