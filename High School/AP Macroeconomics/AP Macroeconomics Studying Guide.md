## Unit 1
Economics is all about scarcity!

### PPC
A shift in PPC is by changing human capital or imports. But a shift IN a point in a PPC is by changing employment rate.
- PPC can show opportunity cost through a shift of a point ALONG a PPC curve, not changing into a new curve.

Decrease in supply increases price and decrease quantity

More capital goods = more economy growth

### Absolute and Comparative Advantages
Absolute Advantage: whoever has higher production or does something in less time

Comparative Advantages:
- Comparative: check the opportunity cost of producing Good A by measuring Good B. (so if 15 cars = 5 planes, then 1 car = 1/3 plane and 1 plane = 3 cars). Do this for 2 countries, and check who has the lower opportunity cost, then that will have the greater comparative advantage.
- ex Note that there are output and input questions. Higher on input is good, and lower on output questions is good (output question is usually measured through 1 hour, so lower time to make something is good)
- ex quick and dirty: multiply the cross boxes for opportunity costs. greater number = that product should be specialized by that country. A country cannot be good at both goods.

## Unit 2

### GDP
GDP:
- 1 year
- dollars
- new goods and services, not old (intermediate goods not counted)
- within a country

nominal GDP increases faster than real GDP due to no inflation.
- nominal/real GDP = GDP price deflator

GDP measurements (should all end up the same):
1. Expenditure approach - add up all spending on final goods/services
2. Income approach - add up all income earned from selling final goods/services
3. Value-added approach - add up dollar value added at each stage of production process

Expenditure approach:
- C - consumption (70%) by individuals
- G - government (physical or military or other services). not transfer payments like welfare
- I - investments (16%) by business, mainly tools and equipment
- Xn - net exports (exports - imports = -3%)

Income approach:
- wages, interest, profit, rent (WIPR)

Intermediate goods, used goods, stock and bonds, transfer payments, nonmarket (unpaid work), and illegal activities are not counted in GDP

Limitations of GDP:
- P - population. solved by GDP by capita
- I - inequality. distribution of wealth among people
- E - environment. more pollution increases GDP, such as cleaning up oil spills
- S - shadow economy. volunteer work, people who do things themselves (like gardening or baking, or black markets)

### Labor Force and Employment
Labor force (full + part time jobs + actively looking for work):
- older than 16
- able and willing to work
- not institutionalized in jails or hospitals
- not in military, school, or retired
- have to be actively seeking a job

0% unemployment is impossible: must have frictional and structural

GDP Price Deflator: nominal/real GDP (measures price of all goods produced, including government and businesses, rather than just individual consumers)

unemployment = unemployed/labor force
labor force participation rate = labor force/all people who can work

- people who are part time workers are still counted as fully employed even if they need 2 jobs
- discouraged workers means that people don't want to seek a job anymore, so they aren't counted as part of the labor force, then that means unemployment actually DECREASES.

### CPI and Inflation
Problems with CPI:
1. substitution bias (even if good's price goes up, people may not buy that product anymore). CPI overstates inflation since consumers will buy lower priced substitute goods.
2. new products cannot be compared to a base year
3. product quality is not accounted for

lenders, people with fixed incomes, and savers are hurt by inflation
borrowers are helped by inflation

inflation rate is change in prices
- year 2 - year 1/year 1 (CPI values)

cost push inflation: AS shifts left increases price level (caused by increase in price of key resource like oil or steel)

demand pull inflation: AD shifts right (people are buying more goods at a limited supply, increasing price)

### Circular Flow Model
In the circular flow model:
- resources and money flow go opposite ways
- there is a resource and product market
- businesses and people both demand and supply, either from the product or resource market
- the government is the public entity that takes in tax to provide for public goods, transfer payments (subsidies and welfare), and government spending projects

factors of production and factor payments (makes up the income approach of GDP):
- land - rent
- labor - wages
- capital - interest
- entrepreneurship - profit

## Unit 3
Higher employment at higher GDPs

### Aggregate Demand
Anything that affects the expenditure model of GDP will affect aggregate demand. Is downwards sloping because:
- real wealth effect: increased price level decreases purchasing power, leading to less goods and services bought
- interest rate effect: increase in price level increases interest rates, decreasing investment
- exchange rate effect: increase price reduces people from foreign countries from buying our goods

shifters of aggregate demand:
- decrease interest rate = higher AD
- appreciation of US dollar = lower AD (exports will decrease)
- government deficit spending = higher AD
- greater investment = higher AD

demand pull inflation shifts AD right

### Aggregate Supply
SRAS is affected by anything that widely affects production:
- government actions (taxes, subsidies, regulations)
- resource prices
- change in productivity (such as improved technology)
- supply shock: unexpected decrease or increase in key resources (cost push inflation shifts AS left)
- expected prices cause short run effects but eventually cause long run shifts back to the LRAS

wages and resource prices in the SRAS is not flexible. takes long time for them to change.

LRAS is full employment and potential GDP. shows maximum production similar to PPC.
- anything that shifts PPC shifts the LRAS (productivity, new resources or capitals)

stagflation = SRAS decreases, high unemployment, high inflation

### Long Run Questions
LRAS only shifts if:
1. decrease in interest rates shifts both AS and AD rightwards, so LRAS shifts right
2. destruction of capital (less resources) shifts both AS and AD leftwards, so LRAS shifts left. improvement of capital (both physical and human) shifts AS and AD rightwards, so LRAS shifts right.

economy always ends up at LRAS even without government policy
- it is always the SRAS that shifts back to the LRAS as wages and resource prices become flexible and adjust

no relationship between price level and real GDP in long run
the LRAS is the natural rate of unemployment (full employment)

if there is less interest rates, then more investment (AD shifts right) will occur, especially in capital tools, which will ultimately bring AS rightwards, leading to a greater LRAS, or a greater PPC. This is the concept of economic growth.
- also due to infrastructure/education (increases physical/human capital to increase LRAS)
- higher federal budget deficit increases interest rates, reduces investments, and reduces LRAS

### Multiplier Effect
marginal propensity to consume and save (MPC and MPS). MPC + MPS = 1

simple spending multiplier: $\dfrac{1}{MPS}$

tax multiplier: 1 less than spending multiplier = $1-\frac{1}{MPS}$ or $\frac{MPC}{MPS}$
- Tax Change $\times$ Tax Multiplier = total change in spending
- use this if transfer payments change

money multiplier: $\dfrac{1}{\text{reserve requirement}}$

### Fiscal Policies
GDP = AD = C + I + G + XN

fiscal policies affect spending and taxation. either expansionary or contractionary
- non-discretionary = automatic stabilizers = unemployment benefits, welfare benefits (increases transfer payments and thus government spending), progressive income taxes
- discretionary = in a recession, increasing spending or decreasing tax cuts (which increases consumption)

## Unit 4
commodity money is an item that has intrinsic value (gold, silver)
fiat money serves as money but has no real value

M1 checking account:
- highest liquidity
- includes currency in circulation, checking accounts
- assets like cars and houses are not money because they have low liquidity

M2 near moneys:
- M1 but also saving deposits, time deposits (CDs) and money market funds

higher interest rates = lower bond prices

the reserve requirement of banks affects loanable money - creating ample/excess reserves
- money multiplier = $\frac{1}{\text{reserve ratio}}$

 The money multiplier only affects ample/excess money by banks.
 - Initial deposit $\times$ (1-reserve ratio) $\times$ money multiplier = increase in money supply

### Money Supply
affecting money supply is called monetary policy. fiscal policy only controls government spending and taxation

money supply is vertical because it does not change based on interest rate

shifters of money demand
- higher price level = demand for money shifts right
- higher income = higher demand for money
- technology like credit card = lower demand for money

shifters of money supply
- reserve requirement - decrease RR increases money supply
- discount rate - decrease in discount rate increases money supply.
- open market operations - done the most, when the fed buys or sells bonds/securities/treasury notes. buying bonds increases money supply, and all the extra money from bonds are in excess reserves

expansionary monetary policy (occurs during recession)
- increases money supply, decreases interest rates, therefore increasing investments and increasing AD
- lowering RR, decreasing discount rates, buying bonds

ample reserves is the money bank holds in reserve
- the policy rate is the interest rate that the central bank (feds) give to other banks when they store their reserve money to them (interest on reserves).
- interest on reserves is the interest the FED pays banks to hold their reserves
- to conduct expansionary policy, interest on reserves is lowered. then banks will be discouraged to store money into the FED, and lend their money more. this increases money supply.
- to conduct contractionary policy, interest on reserves is increased. then banks will be encouraged to store money, and lend less money, and money supply decreases.

increasing money supply decreases interest rates increases investments, which increases output and AD, increasing price level and quantity demanded
- reducing reserve requirement, buying bonds, decreasing discount rate

### Quantity Theory of Money
money supply $\times$ velocity of money = price level (nominal GDP/real GDP) $\times$ real GDP

in long run, increasing money supply will increase price level (due to higher AD and inflation), which increases demand for money, and lowers GDP to the original.

### Reserve Market Graph
- quantity of reserves vs policy rate
- the upper bound is the discount rate is the rate banks can borrow from the fed, so it eventually gets capped off.
- the lower bound is the interest on reserves set by the fed sets a floor for the reserve market. the interest on reserves can be changed by the fed.
- limited reserves is left of the supply and ample reserves is right of the supply.
	- if central bank wants to stimulate economy in a recession, the interest on reserves will decrease, which will increase investment.
- changes in open market operations does not affect the policy rate in ample reserves.

### Loanable Funds
if interest rate is low, the quantity of loanable funds is less.

government borrowing (deficit spending) will increase interest rates because they need to borrow more money (causing demand for loans to increase), causing the crowding out effect. increased interest rates decreases investment and growth.
- ex deficit spending occurs during recession when the government is spending more to speed up the economy

increase in personal savings shift supply of loans right
investors moving money out of country reduces supply of loans
reducing tax rate on loans increases supply of loans

uses real interest rates because lenders and borrowers account for inflation when they make decisions.

### Bank Balance Sheets
shows assets and liabilities for a bank
- demand deposits - money deposited in a bank in checking accounts
- required reserves - money that banks must hold
- excess reserves - money that banks can loan out
- owner's equity - money owed to the owners/shareholders of a bank

required reserves money/demand deposits = reserve requirement number
depositing cash into a checking accounts has no change in the M1 money supply

## Unit 5

### Phillips Curve
negative or positive output gaps (or any shifts on AD) on the ADAS model will cause the point on the short run Philips curve to shift.

Any shift of AS will cause the entire SRPC line to shift. such as supply shocks. negative supply shocks shift the Philips curve rightwards.

But when the ADAS self corrects, it will cause the entire SPRC to shift left (negative output gap) or right (positive output gap).

the long run Philips curve is vertical at the NRU and shifts if structural or frictional unemployment increases.

intersection of LRPC and SRPC is the expected interest rate

### Keynesian Economics
government spending and stimulation is helpful during recession, challenging classical economists that it self corrects over time

## Unit 6

### Current and Capital Accounts
there is current and financial (capital) accounts.
- if current account is deficit, the capital account will surplus because their capital outflow is negative

current account:
- tracks difference between country's net exports, investment income, net transfer payments. It's only a one time deal.

capital account:
- tracks ownership of assets held by foreigners and ownership of foreign assets. It will always be making money.

- ex if China has a trade surplus from the US, their inflow < outflow because they will spend more money on US assets

financial account surplus = inflow > outflow

a current account deficit must mean a financial account surplus

### Foreign Exchange
Shifters of foreign exchange:
1. taste and preferences (British tourists go to US increases demand for dollars, appreciating dollars)
2. price level or inflation (more US inflation = depreciation of dollars)
3. interest rates (higher interest rate = appreciation of dollars)
4. income (higher income of Americans = greater purchases = dollar depreciates)

increase in demand appreciates a currency 

appreciation decreases net exports
depreciation increases net exports

## Other Questions
imports does not affect GDP and does not increase or lower unemployment
increasing money supply = inflation in long run
expanding government unemployment benefits increases frictional unemployment since more people will have less incentive to find a job quickly

increase interest rate means greater purchase of those assets
