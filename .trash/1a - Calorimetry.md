Heat can be measured with this equation in J or kJ:
$$q_{rxn} = -q_{liquid} = -mC_{p}\Delta T$$
- m is the mass of water and reactants
- q depends on mass, change in temperature, and type of material
- If $\Delta T$ is positive, the q is negative

$\Delta H$ is kJ/mol, which is the heat transferred per mol
- So find q to get kJ and divide by the moles to get $\Delta H_{rxn}$
- Positive $\Delta H$ is endothermic and negative $\Delta H$ is exothermic

Ccal is the specific heat of the calorimeter.
