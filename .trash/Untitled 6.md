think from a business perspective: how to increase profits, what investments lead to highest ROI, break down revenue streams and focus on the most profitable ones, think about operational costs (fixed cost)

Start broad, state how to solve and dive in using data, then summarize.
confirm understandings
Preface questions with a statement describing where you are going with your questioning.
- ex “Now I'd like to ask some questions about the client's distribution channels.”

# Profitability
Profit = revenue - cost
Revenue = q x p
Costs = FC + VC (VC is cost per unit x q)

check if there are short term or long term solutions

If revenue is going down, then determine if it is external of internal.
- External - are competitions facing similar issues? If yes, then it is external and industry wide. How can you fix an industry wide problem?
- Internal - internal root cause 

whether to increase unit price? check market power, product moat, justification
how to increase sales? focus on new or current customers with new or current products
how to decrease costs? FC vs VC costs, cost allocation
- ex if FC is high, then it might benefit from economies of scale

If costs are going up, then it is an operations problem

- ex My limited knowledge of the food service industry is not exactly helpful, so to obtain more information, may I ask how they segment the revenue in this market?

# 7P for Marketing
Competitive situation or market entry cases.

Product, Price, Place, and Promotion – thus, “4P”; note that “Place” does not pertain to any physical location, but the channel used by the company to deliver its products to its customers.

People – those performing the services
Process – how those services are delivered to the customers
Physical Evidence – the visible, physical clues about the services (think of decorations inside a restaurant).

# Porter 5F
The Five Forces Model describes the industry around that business, not the business itself.

Threat of new entrants, substitutes, competitive rivalry, bargaining power of customers and suppliers

# Merger
Costs vs Benefits of merging
Values of both companies
Synergy of both companies
