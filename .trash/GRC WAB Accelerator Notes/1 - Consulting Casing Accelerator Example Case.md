Snack Food Acquisition Casing
- A US snack foods company specializing in snacking peanuts, Peanut Co., is planning to acquire another company specializing in snacking almonds, Almond Co. Peanut Co is the market leader in peanuts, but overall segment is growing slowly compared to the market and they want to diversify. Is this a good idea?

1. Clarify objective - does the client have any specific financial metrics or objectives in mind? What is the timeline?
2. Clarify market - are we looking at the snacking almonds market only? Is the trend affecting the entire snacking nut industry?
3. Business model, SWOT, acquisition deal price, client expertise, brand image and dilution, location (West vs East coast brand)

External Considerations
- Market dynamics: size, growth, trend
- Competitors: preferred brand, barriers to entry?

Internal Considerations
- Financials: profitability, profit margins, growth
- Management, Organizational Culture

Acquisition Impact
- Synergies: cannibalization (determined by customer survey and see if it impact sales) or cross-selling, customer overlap, leveraging current and new distribution networks or innovation
- Risks: deal price cost (negotiate for less?), financing deal, breakeven time, ROI, brand dilution, opportunity cost of acquiring other brands

Segmentation factors:
- Income, age, gender, buy patterns, type of consumers who will buy, consumer size, revenue per consumer

Pressure test: total revenue (market size) / number of people - dose the revenue per consumer make sense?

At the end, summary should be:
- answer the question - acquire or not?
- strong justification using data
- outline key risks with recommendations
- outline 2-3 next steps
- concise in under 1 minute
