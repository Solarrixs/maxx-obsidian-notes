1. The stock solution was prepared at $0.03g/L$, while the molecular weight is $332.31g/mol$. That means $\dfrac{0.03g}{332.31g/mol} = 0.0000902772 \text{mol}$. Using the formula to calculate molarity, which is $M = \dfrac{mol}{L}$,  we get $\dfrac{0.0000902772}{1}$ = $0.0000902772\text{ M}$. After converting from $M \text{ to } \mu M$, we get $90.2772 \mu M$.

2. Given final diluted concentrations in $\mu M$:
	1. 25 - $275\mu L$ of stock and $725\mu L$ of water.
	2. 20 - $220\mu L$ of stock and $780\mu L$ of water.
	3. 15 - $165\mu L$ of stock and $835\mu L$ of water.
	4. 10 - $110\mu L$ of stock and $890\mu L$ of water.
	5. 5 - $55\mu L$ of stock and $945\mu L$ of water.

3. For the $10\mu M$ sample, we needed $110\mu L$ of stock and $890\mu L$ of water. Then, for the $1000\mu L$ pipette for water, the number was 089. For the $200\mu L$ pipette for the stock solution, the number was 110.

6. Max absorbance according to our data is: 485.0nm

7. ![[BE1000 HW1 - Spec Lab graph 2.png]] The extinction coefficient is the slope of the line because $A=\epsilon lc$, but $l = 1$, so $\dfrac{A}{c} = \epsilon$. That means the extinction coefficient is $0.0287 mol^{-1}cm^{-1}$.

8. Our unknown sample had an absorbance value of 0.463741054. Based on the standard curve formula, $A=\epsilon lc \to 0.463741054=0.0287\times 1\times c$, so $c = 16.158224878 = 16.16\mu M$
