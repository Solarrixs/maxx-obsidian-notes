**What**: A mathematics course in UPenn for [[Multi-Variable Calculus]].

**Timeframe**: 

**Resources**: The Calculus Blue videos: [Volume 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8erL0pXF3JYm7VaTdKDaWc8Q3FuP8Sa7)

**Plan**: Attempt to follow the recommended [schedule](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/Calc%20BLUE%20schedule.pdf). Expected to be learnt in 14 weeks, but because I already have multi-calculus background, I should be able to do it within 8 weeks of the summer.

**Feedback Loop**: Do previous the Calculus Blue exams [here](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/114E%20FINAL%202017.pdf), [here](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/114E%20FINAL%202018.pdf), and [here](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/114E%20FINAL%202019.pdf) and assignments [here](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/CALC%20BLUE%20DISCUSSION%20QUESTIONS.pdf) and [here](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/BLUE/CALC%20BLUE%20RECITATION%20QUESTIONS.pdf).

**End Goal**: Pass the MATH 1410 placement exam to jump into Linear Algebra: MATH 2400.
