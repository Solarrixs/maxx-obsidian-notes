Right now, I'm fascinated by the theory of creating synthetic intelligence through biological organoids. Essentially, it involves growing a 3D brain in a petri dish and connecting it to a computer, enabling it to think independently and perform tasks. The concept that future computers might operate on biological chips rather than silicon chips captivates me. It's not just about merging the organic and digital but also revolutionizing how we perceive computing.

I'm so engrossed in this idea that I'm actually took it into my own hands and am now leading a project called "Nano-Neuro Semiconductors" across several campuses, including MIT, UPenn, UMich, and the University of Melbourne. We are all at various stages, but so far, we have successfully designed and fabricated bio-compatible semiconductors and cultivated rat neurons to resemble a brain network. Currently, I am focused on incorporating carbon nanotubes into our semiconductor design to scale up the brain network.
