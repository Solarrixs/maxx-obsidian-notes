Tech and Outreach community

**How will you stay committed to our club throughout your time at Penn? Please give specific examples and actionable steps**
planning on 2 clubs
lots of free time
passionate about EENT
specific examples + steps to convince committee that ill attend meetings and events
how i will contribute to committee (tech and outreach)

**TECHNOLOGY: What vision do you have for the future of technology and its impact on humanity? (You can be very broad or very niche, or anything in between.)**
neuromorphic computing - big data, AI processes

**TECHNOLOGY: Briefly describe a project you are most proud of. How did you work with others and what difficulties did you encounter?**
protein modeling research + help from professors around universities + awards + getting started in so many new fields and learning about them

**OUTREACH: What types of contributions do you anticipate making to WUEC through your role in Outreach? (e.g., what creative methods would you employ to acquire and engage our external stakeholders)?**
to make it so members have a pipeline to ask questions
talk about company + free advertising

**OUTREACH: In our experience, successful outreach requires an innovative, entrepreneurial mindset, as well as resilience and careful management of the interests of all parties involved. Please keep these qualities in mind as you answer the following scenario: BTS is a popular, South-Korean boy band consisting of 7 members who compose, sing, and produce their own music. The band was assembled and is currently managed by HYBE Co., a South-Korean multinational entertainment company that orchestrates BTS’ careers (i.e., HBYE has exclusive control over BTS’s music licensing and distribution, brand image, PR, and all event and product affiliations). One of BTS’ members, Suga, is both a musician (rapper) as well as a music producer. As such, his entrepreneurial experiences and insight would be invaluable for a proposed WUEC panel discussion on innovation within the music industry. How would you go about securing Suga’s participation in our panel? You have approximately 2 weeks to complete this task.**
