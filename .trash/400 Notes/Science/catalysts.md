Substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being consumed.
- decreasing the activation energy ($E_{a}^{'}$ < $E_{a}$) and increases the $k$ value ($rate_{catalyzed} > rate_{uncatalyzed}$) ([[rate of reaction]]).

$k=A \cdot e^{-E_{a}/RT}$

## Types of Catalysts
Heterogenous: reactants and catalysts are in different phases (usually solid). Reactants undergoes adsorption and then are released after a reaction occurs.
- ex Haber synthesis of ammonia
- ex Ostwald process for nitric acid production
- ex Catalytic converters

Homogeneous: reactants and catalysts are dispersed in a single phase (usually liquid). More efficient
- ex Acid and base catalysis
