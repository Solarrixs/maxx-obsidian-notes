The more we invest in something, the more commitment we feel towards it.

The investment doesn't need to be financial (example: reading a bad book or sticking with a bad friend).

The important thing to note is that we need to take a loss to prevent throwing good money after the bad choices.

Studied by Hal Arkes and Catherine Blumer in the 1980s.
