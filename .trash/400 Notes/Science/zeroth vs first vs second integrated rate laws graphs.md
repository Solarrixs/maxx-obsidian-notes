## Graphs
zeroth order rate law: negative linear graph (time against $[A]$) with slope = k.
- $[A]_{t}=-kt+[A]_{0}$

first order rate law: negative linear graph (time against $ln[A]$) with slope = k.
- $\ln[A]_{t}=-kt+\ln[A]_{0}$

second order rate law: positive linear graph (time against $\dfrac{1}{[A]}$) with slope = k.
- $\frac{1}{[A]_{t}}=kt+\frac{1}{[A]_{0}}$
