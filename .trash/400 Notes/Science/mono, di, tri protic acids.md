## Monoprotic Acids
Only have $1H$ in front of the chemical name.
- ex $HCl \rightarrow H^{+}+ Cl^-$

When a monoprotic acid is weak, it will more likely stay together as a molecule. Few ions produced.
- double arrow will be used in reaction equation

When a monoprotic acid is strong, the molecule will completely disassociate and produce many ions.

## Diprotic Acids
Have $2H$ in front of the chemical name.
- ex $H_2SO_{4} \rightarrow H^{+}+ HSO_4^-$

Will disassociate the hydrogen one at a time resulting in 2 disassociating equations.
The first dissociating equation is stronger.
1. & $H_2SO_{4} \rightarrow H^{+}+ HSO_4^-$
2. & $HSO_{4}^{-}  \leftrightarrow H^{+}+ SO_4^{2-}$

## Triprotic Acids
Have $3H$ in front of the chemical name.
- ex $H_3PO_{4} \leftrightarrow H^++H_2PO_4^-$

Will disassociate the hydrogen one at a time resulting in 3 disassociation equations.
The first dissociating equation is stronger.
1. & $H_3PO_{4} \leftrightarrow H^++H_2PO_4^-$
2. & $H_2PO_4^{-} \leftrightarrow H^{+}+ HPO_4^{2-}$
3. & $HPO_{4}^{2-} \leftrightarrow H^{+}+ PO_4^{3-}$
