1. gas molecules constantly move randomly in straight lines
2. volume of [[ideal gases]] (and thus movement of gas particles) is directly proportional to Kelvin temperature
3. volume of [[ideal gases]] is insignificant
4. gas molecules are spaced apart from each other, resulting to weak [[intermolecular forces]] between gas molecules, leading to neither attractive nor repulsive forces on each other.
5. full transfer of energy during the frequent gas collisions (elastic collisions). net energy of the gas sample is constant

the **average** kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature which is proportional to volume of the gas, represented by the [[maxwell boltzmann distribution of gas speeds]]
$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \propto Temperature \propto Volume$

for a real gas to be like an ideal gas, you want high temperature but low pressure.
very light gases (like Helium) naturally behaves similar to an ideal gas.
