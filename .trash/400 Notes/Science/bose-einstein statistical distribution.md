Describes one of the two possible ways in which non-interacting and indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].

This only applies to [[boson|bosons]].

At low temperatures, bosons behave differently from [[fermions]] such that an unlimited number of bosons can condense into the same energy state, resulting in the [[bose-einstein condensate]].

This was first introduced for [[photons]] in 1924 by Bose and generalized to atoms by [[Einstein]] in 1925.
