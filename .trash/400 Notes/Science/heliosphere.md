See [[stellar-wind bubble]] for a general type of [[astrosphere]] generated around a star.

The heliosphere is specific towards the [[sun]].

It is a [[magnetosphere]] and [[astrosphere]] of the Sun that is basically a big bubble like region of space. The bubble is continuously being inflated by [[plasma]] originating from the sun (from the [[solar wind]]).
