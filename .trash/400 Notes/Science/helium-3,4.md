When Helium-4 (or Helium-3) isotope is cooled to -270C (2.2K), it becomes a [[superfluids|superfluid]]. This transition temperature point is known as the Lambda point, where helium I turns into helium II.

Helium is special because it remains as a fluid all the way to [[absolute zero]].

Consists of 2 [[protons]], 2 [[electron]], and 2 [[neutrons]].

As a superfluid, it behaves like a [[boson]]. At normal temperatures, it contains [[fermions]] that have Â±1/2 spins. However, at super cold temperatures (approaching [[absolute zero]]), the fermions form pairs, creating whole number spins, a characteristic of bosons. This causes [[bose einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein condensation]].

Helium-3 has $\frac{1}{2}$ spin and is thus a [[fermions|fermion]]
Helium-4 has 0 spin [[boson|bosons]]
