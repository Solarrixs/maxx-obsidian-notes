calculate the [[molarity]], then convert the moles into grams (by multiplying the number of moles by the GFM of the solution). This is the mass of solutes needed to be measured into the volumetric flask to create a certain concentration of solution.

Add the solute to the volumetric flask using a funnel and a pipette, then add distilled water into the funnel as well. The meniscus should be on the red marking of the volumetric flask.
