A type of [[intermolecular forces]] between an ion (salts) and a polar molecules (dipoles), which have [[covalent bonds#polar covalent bonds]].

In water, molecules with ion dipole forces will dissociate and become soluble.
- ex Dissociation Equation: $NaCl_{(s)}\Leftrightarrow Na^{+}_{(aq)}+Cl^{-}_{(aq)}$. Always start as a solid into liquid. Metals are written first.

The dissociated $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ will experience [[ion dipole forces]] with water: $Na^+$ is attracted to the partial negative of $O$ and $Cl^-$ is attracted to the partial positive of $H$.

Stronger than [[dipole dipole forces]], because the charge of an ion is stronger than the partial charge of a dipole.
- This is the reason why saltwater boils at higher temperatures and freeze at lower temperatures compared to water.
