The Sun is a star the center of the [[solar system]] and radiates energy produced by [[nuclear fusion]] in the [[stellar core]] as visible light (through the [[incandescence]]), [[ultraviolet light]], and [[infrared radiation]].

The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the entire Solar System. 73% consists of [[hydrogen]] and 25% consists of [[helium]], with small quantities of heavier elements (oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron).

## Fusion of the Sun
The Sun fuses 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] per second in its core, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy per second in the process of [[Hydrogen Fusion]], in particular the [[proton-proton chain fusion]] process. As helium accumulates in its core, it grows brighter.

when [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has depleted (in 5 billion years), its core will increase in density and temperature, resulting in the expansion of its outer layers - transforming the Sun into a [[red-giant star]]. The expansion would engulf [[mercury]] and [[venus]]. This will take 5 billion years to happen. It will then shed its outer layers to become a [[white dwarf]] .

## Classification
According to its [[spectral class]], the Sun is a [[G2-type main-sequence star]] (G2V) and is within the [[population I star]] class.

## Formation
It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the [[gravitational collapse]] of matter within a region of a [[molecular clouds|molecular cloud]].

## Layers of the Sun
The [[corona]] is the hottest region of the sun.

## Other Phenomenon of the Sun
It takes 100 million years for the energy generated in the core of the sun to reach the surface of the sun.

The [[sunspot]] cycle lasts 11 years.
