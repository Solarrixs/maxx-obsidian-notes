both acids and bases are caustic. acid burns are weaker and immediate while base burns are stronger and takes a long time.

strong acids and bases disassociates completely (100% disassociation) and breaks into ions. This will use a one directional arrow for a reaction (typically [[arrhenius acids and bases]]). Strong acids and bases will form strong electrolytes.
- all group 1 and group 2 (group 2 is only Barium Hydroxide) soluble hydroxides are strong bases. everything else is a weak base
