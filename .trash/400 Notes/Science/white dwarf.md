White dwarfs resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]], compared to [[main-sequence star]], which resist collapse through thermal pressure.

Normally, the [[stellar core]] of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion]] of nuclei of lighter elements into heavier ones.
