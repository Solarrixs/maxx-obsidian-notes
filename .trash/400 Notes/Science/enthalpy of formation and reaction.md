## Standard Enthalpy of Formation
Standard [[enthalpy]] is at 25C, 1 atm, and [[molarity|1 molar]] concentration solutions
- Standard enthalpy of formation is $\Delta H_{f}^o$
- Is the heat change that results when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements at a pressure of 1 atm and 25C

The standard enthalpy of formation of any element in its most stable form is 0
- All metals are in (s) phase. Also keep in mind the [[diatomic elements]].
- ex [[ozone]], the [[allotropes|allotrope]] of [[oxygen]], has a non-zero standard enthalpy value, and is thus not the most stable form of the element oxygen

Keep in mind [[diatomic elements]] and what elements naturally exist as solid, liquid, gas

## Standard Enthalpy of Reaction
$\Delta H_{rxn}^o$ is the [[enthalpy]] of a reaction carried out at 1 atm.

$aA + bB \rightarrow cC +dD$
$\Delta H_{rxn}^0 = \sum n\Delta H_{f}(\text{products}) - \sum m\Delta H_{f}{\text{(reactants)}}$
