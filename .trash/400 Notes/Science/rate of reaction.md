Determines the change in concentration of a reactant or product over time.

- ex A $\rightarrow$ B
the rate of A is $-\dfrac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t}$ (negative because it is a reactant and is decreasing in concentration)

Anything surrounded by rackets represent the [[molarity]].
- ex $[A]$, $[B]$

## Average vs. Instantaneous Rate of Reaction
note: only write the rate law for the slowest step of a reaction with multiple elementary steps.

average: [[average rate of a reaction]]
instantaneous: [[integrated rate law of a reaction]] and [[instantaneous rate law of a reaction]]
- integrated is for 1 reactant but two concentrations while instant is for 2 reactants

## Sample Problems
> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> $4NO_{2}+O_{2} \rightarrow 2N_{2}O_{5}$
> Suppose that in the reaction, molecular oxygen is reacting at the rate of 0.024M/s.
> 1. At what rate is $N_2O_5$ being formed?
> 2. At what rate is $NO_2$ reacting?

> > 1. $-\dfrac{\Delta [O_2]}{\Delta t}$ = $\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\Delta [N_2O_5]}{\Delta t}$, then $\Delta[N_2O_{5}]= 2 \Delta[O_2]$ = 2(0.024M/s), then $\Delta[N_2O_{5}]$ = 0.048M/s

> > 2. $-\dfrac{\Delta [O_2]}{\Delta t}$ = $-\dfrac{1}{4}\dfrac{\Delta [NO_2]}{\Delta t}$, then $\Delta[NO_2]= 4 \Delta[O_2]$ = 4(0.024M/s), then $\Delta[NO_2]$ = 0.096M/s
