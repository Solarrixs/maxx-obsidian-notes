A type of question asked on the [[AP Physics C]] exams.

Involves uniformly accelerated objects falling under the force of gravity ($g$).
- at the peak of any trajectory, the y-component of velocity is 0
- object's speed and time difference from the peak as it passes a certain height is exactly the same on the way up as it is on the way down
- the only force and acceleration is $g$ or $9.8m/s^2$ downwards at all times
