See: [[mono, di, tri protic acids]].

Break down either diprotic or triprotic acids into their separate [[equilibrium]] equations, then take the [[solubility for acids]] for each one.

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> Calculate the concentrations of all the species present at equilibrium with a $0.10M$ solution of $H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}$, given that $K_{a_{1}} = 6.5 \times 10^{-2}$ and $K_{b_{1}} = 6.1 \times 10^{-5}$.
