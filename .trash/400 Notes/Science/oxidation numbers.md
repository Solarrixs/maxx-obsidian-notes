## Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers

### Basic Rules
Sum of oxidation states in compound equals to 0.
- Coefficients of compounds do not matter.

Oxidation numbers for single [[diatomic elements]] and elements are 0.

In monoatomic ions, the charge of the ion is the oxidation state

In polyatomic ions, add up the separate oxidation states, and the sum of the oxidation states will be the oxidation number of the polyatomic ions

### Oxygen
oxygen $\rightarrow$ -2
$OF_{2}$ $\rightarrow$ +2
$H_{2}O_{2}$, $O_{2}^{-2}$ $\rightarrow$ -1
$O_{2}^{-}$ $\rightarrow$ $-\frac{1}{2}$

### Hydrogen
[[hydrogen]] + non-metal $\rightarrow$ +1
[[hydrogen]] + metal/middle of chemical formula $\rightarrow$ -1 (**hydride**)

### Must-know
Group 1 metals are +1
Group 2 metals are +2
Fluorine is always -1
