Bronsted acid is a [[protons]] donor
- Must contain at least one ionizable proton
Bronsted base is a [[protons]] acceptor

All Bronsted acid and base reaction are reversible since it deals with weak acids and bases. Thus, Bronsted acid and bases will not go to completion, signified by a double arrow, and only remain in equilibrium.

Bronsted reactions result in conjugate acid and base pairs
- ex Conjugate Pair: $NH_{3}, NH_4^+$ and Conjugate Pair: $H_2O,OH^-$
- The one with more H is the acid within the conjugate pair
- the stronger an acid, the weaker its conjugate base, and the stronger a base, the weaker its conjugate acid.

A substance capable of acting as either an acid or a base is called amphiprotic or amphoteric.
- acts as a base when combined with something more acidic than itself and an acid with something more basic than itself
- ex $H_2O$ can be both an acid and a base since $H_2O$ can donate a $H+$ and turns into $OH^-$ and there is a reaction called the [[auto-ionization of water]].
