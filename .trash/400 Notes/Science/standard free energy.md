## Gibbs Free Energy
$\Delta G_{rxn}$ of a reaction under 25C, 1atm, and 1 [[molarity|molar concentration]].

Has the same formula as [[bond enthalpy]].

Or you can use: $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$ in $kJ/mol$.
- $\Delta G < 0$, then the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction, or thermodynamically favorable in the forward [[rate of reaction]].
- $\Delta G>0$, then the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse direction, or thermodynamically favorable in the reverse [[rate of reaction]].
- $\Delta G = 0$, then the reaction is at [[equilibrium]].

### Gibbs Free Energy During Phase Transitions
During phase transitions (at [[equilibrium]]), $\Delta G = 0$, so $T\Delta S = \Delta H$
- $\Delta S$ is always in $kJ/mol$

## Chemical Equilibrium
$\Delta G^{o} = - RT\ln Q$
- $R$ is the gas constant
- $T$ is the Kelvin temperature
- $Q$ is the [[reaction quotient]], but it can be re-written as $K$.

The smaller the value of $Q$, the cell will be further from [[equilibrium]] and thus increase the voltage, leading to a larger cell potential.

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> $H_{f} = 10.9kJ/mol$ and $H_{v} = 31.0kJ/mol$. Calculate the entropy changes for solid to liquid and liquid to vapor transitions for benzene. At 1atm, benzene melts at 5.5C and boils at 80.1C.
