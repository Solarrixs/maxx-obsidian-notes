Also expressed as $K_{A}$.
- also see: [[solubility for acids]]

A strong [[base (chemistry)]] has no bases remaining at [[equilibrium]], and thus the $K_{B}$ formula will not have a denominator and is very large.

A weak [[base (chemistry)]] does not disassociate fully at [[equilibrium]], and thus the $K_{B}$ formula will have a denominator and is very small.

$K_{w} = (K_{a})(K_{b})$
