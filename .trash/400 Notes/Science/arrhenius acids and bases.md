Arrhenius acid produces $H^+$ (hydrogen ion or proton), or $H_3O^+$ (hydronium ion) in water.
- ex $HCl$ → $H^+$ + $Cl^-$

Arrhenius base produces $OH^-$ in water.
- ex $LiOH$ → $LI^+$ + $OH^-$

Forms a [[neutralization reaction]].
Has an H in the front and OHin the formula.

Arrhenius acid and bases have reactions that will go to completion. Thus, these reactions are typically strong [[acid and bases]].
