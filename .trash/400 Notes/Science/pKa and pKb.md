pKa is used to describe [[acid (chemistry)]] strengths relative to other acids.
- Lower pKa values means more acidic acids
- $pK_{a}=-\log(K_{a})$

pKb is used to describe [[base (chemistry)]] strengths relative to other bases.
- $pK_{b} = -\log(K_{b})$

$pOH + pH = 14$ and at [[equivalence point#Half Equivalence Point]], $pOH = pK_{b}$.

Used in the [[hendelson-hasselbalch buffer pH equation]].
