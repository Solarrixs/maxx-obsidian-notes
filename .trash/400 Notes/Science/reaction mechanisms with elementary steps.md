The reaction mechanism is the overall progress of a chemical reaction can be represented at the molecular level by a series of elementary steps/reactions leading to a product.
- The number of peaks (transition states) on a [[potential energy diagrams]] is determined by the number of elementary steps.

Intermediates are chemicals formed during the first elementary step and consumed by the second elementary step. Thus it won't be seen in the original equation or in the final equation.
- If the 1st elementary step is fast, then it is in [[equilibrium]]. The rate laws for the reactants is equal to the rate law for the products.

An elementary step that is the exact same as the rate law is the slowest step, and is thus the rate-determining step.

When dealing with elementary steps, use the stoichiometric coefficients to determine the order for each reactant in a rate law.
