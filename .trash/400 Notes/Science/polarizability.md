The ease at which the [[electron]] distribution in the atom or molecule can be distorted.

Increases with greater number of electrons
- Thus greater [[protons]] = greater GFM = chance of an element to become a temporarily dipole and thus strongly participate in [[dispersion forces]].

As there are greater electrons, the proton has less control over the individual electrons. Also the greater atomic radii, the less control the proton have over the individual electrons.

Therefore, at a instant moment in time, there is a greater chance for the electrons to be more concentrated in one side of a molecule rather than be perfectly balanced between molecules.

Only a polar molecule can induce polarization on nonpolar molecules (the vice-versa does not apply).
