Buffers requires a weak acid + (stronger) conjugate base or weak base + (stronger) conjugate acid.
- $K_{A} \times K_{B} = K_{w}$, which is $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ for conjugate acid-base pairs.

Buffers prevent the change of pH in [[homogenous mixtures|solutions]].

To determine the pH of a buffer, use the [[hendelson-hasselbalch buffer pH equation]].
