This is the pathway that the Alpha+GTP subunits interact on.

Activated by Gs [[GPCR]]s → increased cellular activity by converting [[ATP]] into [[cAMP]].
When Gs [[GPCR]] is inactive, the Alpha+GTP and Beta+Gamma subunits rejoin and inhibit Adenylyl Cyclase activation.

Inhibited by Gi GPCRs → decreased cellular activity.
When Gi GPCRs is activated, it will release the Alpha+GTP subunits to inhibit Adenylyl Cyclase activity.
