> 0.5 mol of $H_{2}$ and 0.5 mol of $I_{2}$ was placed in 1L at 430C. $K_{c}$ for $H_{2} + I_{2} \leftrightarrow 2HI$ is 54.3. Calculate the concentrations of the reactants and products.

> > Find the concentration of $H_{2}$ and $I_{2}$ using the [[molarity]] formula to get 0.5M of each.
> > $H_{2}$ and $I_{2}$ goes down by -1X but $HI$ increases by 2X.
> > Thus, the equilibrium for $H_{2}$ and $I_{2}$ is $0.5-X$ and the equilibrium for $HI$ is $2X$.
> > Plugging into the $K_{c}$ equation, you get $\frac{[2X]^2}{[0.5-X][0.5-X]}$, and solving for $X$, you get $X=0.393$.

> $K_{c}$ is 7 at 400C.
> There are 0.25mol of $Br_{2}$ and 0.55mol of $Cl_{2}$ are introduced in a 3L container, what is the equilibrium concentrations of $Br_{2}$, $Cl_{2}$ and $BrCl$, if the equation is $Br_{2} + Cl_{2} \leftrightarrow 2BrCl$

> > $Br_{2}$ is 0.083M and $Cl_{2}$ is 0.18M.
> > Thus, $Br_{2}$ is $0.083-X$ and $Cl_{2}$ is $0.18-X$ and $BrCl$ is $2X$.
> > Then, $K_{c} = \dfrac{[2X]^2}{[0.083-X][0.18-X]} = 7$, then $X = 0.063$.
> > Then, $0.083-0.063 = 0.02$ mol of $Br_{2}$ and $0.18-0.063 = 0.117$ mol of $Cl_{2}$ and $BrCl$ is $2(0.063) = 0.126$
