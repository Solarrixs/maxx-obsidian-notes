#split

Electrons are the lightest stable [[subatomic particle]].
1 mole of electrons = -1 charge. #ankify

First discovered by [[Joseph Thompson]] in 1897 using [[cathode rays]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] expanded upon Thompson's model in the years 1908-1913. Finally, [[Robert Millikan]] figured out the charge of a single electron.

Electrons exist in [[orbital clouds]] around the [[nucleus]]. Each electron follows [[hund's rule]] within orbital clouds.

## Valence Electrons
Valence electrons, which are the outermost electrons or the electrons of the *s* and *p* orbitals, can able to interact with other atoms to form [[chemical bonding|chemical bonds]] and give an element its properties.

## Bohr Model
Shown that electrons orbit the [[nucleus]] at specific fixed radii in energy levels from $n=1$ to $n=7$.
Ejection of an electron from the outermost energy level is measured using [[ionization energy]].
