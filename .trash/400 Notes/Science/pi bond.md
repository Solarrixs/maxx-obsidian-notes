Pi bonds have little strength and shortens bond lengths in [[chemical bonding|chemical bonds]].
- A pi bond cannot be formed by s orbitals since s orbitals only are symmetric across the bond axis

lateral overlap of pi-bonds

unhybridized p orbitals form pi bonds.

Every single bond is 0 pi bond
Every double bond is 1 pi bond
Every triple bond is 2 pi bonds

Delocalized pi bonds result from resonance structures since delocalized [[electron|electrons]] aren't confined to 2 atoms and can move around.
