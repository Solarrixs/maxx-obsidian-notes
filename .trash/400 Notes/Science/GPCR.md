Is a transmembrane protein receptor. Crosses membrane 7 times.
There are different types of GPCR proteins. Activation of each one has different effects.

The end sticking out of the cell is the N-terminal Extracellular Domain (NED).
The end sticking into the cell is the C-terminal Intracellular Domain (CID).

When ligands/hormones cannot enter into the cell as it is blocked by the cellular membrane, it will bind to the NED and trigger a conformational change and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade. This will mediate the function of the ligand through the [[G proteins]] within the cell and recognize activated GPCRs.
