Can act on [[G proteins]] and thus interact with the [[GPCR]]
Special class of [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]]:
- acts on [[ionotrophic receptors]] by using ionic mechanisms to signal across the neuromuscular junction from [[motor neurons]] to striated muscle fibers.
- acts on [[metabotropic receptors]] by being released if you want to focus attention on something - fine-tuning neurons in the brain to the task of taking in only relevant information.

The first [[neurotransmitter]] to be discovered.
