[[enthalpy]] is a state function.

Rules of Hess's law
1. if reaction is reversed, enthalpy is negated ($\Delta H = -\Delta H$)
2. if equation multiple by n, then $\Delta H$ is also multiplied by n
3. If 2+ reactions added, the individual enthalpy value of each reaction can be added to obtain the net change of enthalpy of the overall reaction
