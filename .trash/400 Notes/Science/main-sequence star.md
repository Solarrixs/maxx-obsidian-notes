If a main-sequence star isn't too massive, it'll shed enough mass to form a [[white dwarf]] under the [[chandrasekhar limit]].

If a main-sequence star is large enough, [[electron degeneracy pressure]] will not prevent the hot and dense iron core from collapsing to a great density, leading to the formation of [[neutron star]], [[black holes]], or [[quark stars]].
