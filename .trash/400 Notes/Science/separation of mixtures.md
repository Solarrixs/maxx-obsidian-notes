[[heterogeneous mixtures]]
- Filtration: separates based on differences in solubilities
- Decanting: pouring liquid away
- Magnetism: one substance is magnetic while the other one is not

[[homogenous mixtures]]
- Evaporation: separation based on one soluble substance being dissolved in a liquid (solvent evaporates)
- Chromatography: separates solutes based on differences in charges/polarities or sizes of the molecules
- Distillation: separates solutes based on differences in boiling points (regular distillation requires a difference of boiling points by 25C).
