Lattice energy is defined as the energy required to convert one mole of an ionic solid into gaseous ionic constituents.
- ex $NaCl_{(s)}$ â†’ $Na^+_{(g)}$ + $Cl^-_{(g)}$
- Cannot be measured directly but indirectly through the Born-Haber cycle in kJ/mol.

Formation of bonds release energy.

Formed from [[ionic bonds]].

The two factors that affect the lattice energy is:
1. magnitude of charge associated with the constituent ions (more important)
2. distance between the ions

## Properties
Greater lattice energy has higher melting points.
In ionic solids: volatility, solubility, and hardness.
