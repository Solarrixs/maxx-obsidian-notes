Covalently bounded to the inside of the cellular membrane. Inactive G proteins consist of a GDP, A, B, and Gamma subunits.

Main function is to recognize activated [[GPCR]] and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade.

There are 3 types of G proteins: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma subunits.
When a GPCR is activated, it changes shape, and the G protein will bind to it. This leads to the separation of the 3 G proteins.
- Alpha and GTP mediates the [[adenylyl cyclase]] and [[phospholipiase C]].
- Beta and Gamma mediates the [[ion channels]].
