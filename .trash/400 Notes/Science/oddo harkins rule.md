- The Oddo-Harkins rule states that an element with an even atomic number (Helium, Carbon, Oxygen, etc) are more abundant than elements surrounding it with an odd atomic number.
	- Meaning: oxygen (element 8) will be more abundant than either odd atomic elements nitrogen (element 7) and fluorine (element 9).
- The rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have 1 unpaired proton and thus are likely to capture another, making it an even atomic number.
- Elements with even atomic numbers have paired proton, with each proton balancing the spin of the other, in which the even parity enhances stability.

## Exceptions
 - Hydrogen (element 1) → most abundant element in the Universe (73%). The second most abundant is Helium (25%). Then, Hydrogen and Helium make up 99.9% of the Universe.
 - Beryllium (element 4) → more rare than Lithium (element 3) and Boron (element 5).
	 - This is because lithium, beryllium, and boron are made by [[cosmic ray spallation]] and not [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].
	 - Beryllium also only has 1 stable isotope, causing it to lag in abundance with regard to Lithium and Boron (both of which having 2 stable isotopes).
