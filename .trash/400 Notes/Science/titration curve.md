Titration curves generates a S-shaped graph relating pH and volume of the titrant or standard as it is added.

Half way up the spike of the S-shaped graph is the [[equivalence point]].

## Strong Acid & Base
[[list of strong acids|strong acids]] + [[base (chemistry)]] $\rightarrow$ Neutral Salt + $H_{2}O$

[[net ionic equations|net ionic equation]]: $OH^- + H^+ \leftrightarrow H_{2}O$

Smooth curve.

## Weak Acid & Strong Base
Basic Salt produced.

Initial curve has a dip.

There is a initial buffer zone of minimal pH changes.

For a weak acid, at the [[equivalence point]], there will be more bases compared to the weak acid.
