There are 3 general types of chemical bonds: [[ionic bonds]], [[covalent bonds]], [[metallic bonds]]. Bonding is determined by [[electron#valence electrons|valence electrons]], as all atoms generally want to have a complete octet of having 8 valence electrons, like [[noble gases]], to become stable.

[[infrared radiation]] is used to study chemical bonds within molecules.
microwave radiation is used to study the shape of molecules.
