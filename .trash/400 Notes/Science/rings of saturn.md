Consist of small particle ranging from micrometers to meters.

Mostly made of [[water]] [[ice]] (99.9% water ice) and a trace component of rocky material.

First discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]].

The rings are held in orbit by [[Saturn]]'s gravity and by its moons.

There are gaps within the rings, such as the Cassini Division and the Encke Gap.

Within the Cassini Division are also various structures, including:
- Huygens Gap and Ringlet
- Herschel Gap
- Kuiper Gap

The densest parts of the ring system are the A and B rings, separated by the Cassini Division. Main rings are A (has Encke and Keeler Gaps), B, and C rings, while dusty rings are D (innermost ring), G, and E rings. Dusty rings are called that because of their very small size.
