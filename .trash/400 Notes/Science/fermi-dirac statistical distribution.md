Named after [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Paul Dacriirac]].

This applies only to identical and indistinguishable particles with half-integer spin such as [[fermions]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. This is most commonly applied to [[electron|electrons]].

The opposite of F-D statistics is [[bose-einstein statistical distribution]].
