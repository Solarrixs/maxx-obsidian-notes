Loss aversion is the belief that a negative consequence (a loss) will hurt more than a corresponding positive consequence (a gain) will please.

For example, most people will not accept a 50:50 bet unless the amount they could win is 2x the amount they might lose. So, if it cost $5 to bet, the potential winning has to be more than $10.
