acids have a sour taste.
- ex vinegar owes its taste to acetic acid
- ex citrus fruits contain citric acid

causes color changes in plant dyes.

acids react with [[metals]] to produce [[hydrogen]] gas and salts. this is known as [[hydrogen displacement reaction]].
- except copper (reacts with $HNO_3$ though), silver, gold
- H(x) + Metal → $H_{2(g)}$ + Metal(x)
- a positive test for hydrogen gas is it pops in a wooden splint

acids react with carbonates and bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide gas, salt, and water.
- Acid + Metal Carbonate → Salt + $CO_{2(g)}$ + $H_2O_{(l)}$ (goes to completion due to $CO_2$ gas and $H_2O$ gas)
- three products (with 1 being a gas) results in a polyatomic anion salt
- conducts electricity (electrolyte solution)
- a positive test for carbon dioxide gas is it extinguishes fire or turns bromothymol blue to yellow
