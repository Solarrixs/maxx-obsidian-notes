Also expressed as $K_{A}$.
- also see: [[solubility for bases]]

A strong acid has no acid remaining at [[equilibrium]], and thus the $K_{A}$ formula will not have a denominator and is very large.

A weak acid does not disassociate fully at [[equilibrium]], and thus the $K_{a}$ formula will have a denominator and is very small.

$K_{w} = (K_{a})(K_{b})$
