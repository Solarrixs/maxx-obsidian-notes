If a system at [[equilibrium]] is subjected to stress, the equilibrium will shift to relieve the stress.

## Concentration
if one side increases, then the equilibrium will shift to the opposite side

## Temperature
equilibrium favors the [[endothermic]] reaction with an increase in temperature
temperature causes the most drastic shift, and thus causes the k value ([[equilibrium constant]]) to change

## Pressure
only gases are affected by pressure changes
increasing pressure will shift the reaction to the side with less total moles

## Catalysts
[[catalysts]] makes the reaction's equilibrium to be reached faster, and does not cause a shift
speed up the rate of forward and reverse reactions equally

## Dilution
diluting an aqueous system will cause it to shift to the side with more aqueous species
