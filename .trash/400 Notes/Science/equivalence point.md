Is halfway up the S curve on a [[titration curve]].

At the equivalence point, moles of [[acid (chemistry)]] = moles of [[base (chemistry)]].
- Use $MV=MV$

Is also reached when conductivity is at the lowest value (least number of ions)

## Half Equivalence Point
Simply half of the equivalence point.

Is when $pOH = pK_{b}$ and $pH = pK_{a}$.
