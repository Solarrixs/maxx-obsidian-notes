Covalent bonds are due to molecules sharing [[electron|electrons]] between atoms and weaker than [[ionic bonds]].

The length of the bond between two atoms decreases as the number of shared electron pairs increases (more bonds).
- The more electrons being shared, the shorter the bond.

There can be localized and delocalized electrons based on whether there is more than 1 way of drawing a double/triple covalent bond.

## Properties
Covalent substances have low melting and boiling points. This is opposite of [[ionic bonds]].

## Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
All [[diatomic elements]] and [[noble gases]].
All [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[alkanes]], [[alkenes]], and [[alkynes]].
Most [[organic compounds]] are nonpolar.
All molecules that display symmetry (linear shapes have symmetry).
If the [[electronegativity]] difference between 2 atoms are less than 0.4.

nonpolar molecules must be symmetrical (but it can have non-polar covalent bonds)

## Polar Covalent Bonds
polar molecules (dipoles) must be asymmetrical.
[[hydrogen bond]]: when hydrogen is bonded to N, O, or F.
All molecules that lacks symmetry (bent shapes are not symmetric).
If the [[electronegativity]] difference between 2 atoms is between 0.4 and 2.

The difference in [[electronegativity]] makes one atom becomes partial negative and the other becomes partial positive. The partial negative atom has a greater electron density as it is pulling more electrons toward it.
