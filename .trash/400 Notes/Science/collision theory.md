States that reactant molecules must collide with each other with proper orientation and energy (to overcome the activation energy) in order to yield products.
- Amount of energy reactant molecules need to absorb to "lock on" to each other to create a reaction.
- Once the conditions are met, there is an effective collision reaction, and thus products will be made.

## Factors that Affect Collision Frequency (rate of reaction)
1. temperature - measures average kinetic energy - direct relationship (increases number of collisions)
2. pressure (affects gas only) - forces gas molecules to collide more - direct relationship (increases number of collisions)
3. catalysts - reduce activation energy needed for reaction - always causes faster reaction (but does not affect number of collisions)
4. surface area - allows more contact for collision - direct relationship
5. nature of reactants - [[ionic bonds|ionic solutions]] react faster than [[intermolecular forces|molecular solutions]]
6. concentration - [[molarity]] - direct relationship (increases number of collisions)
