Procedure for preparing a less concentrated [[homogenous mixtures|solutions]] from more concentrated solutions. This lowers the [[molarity]], but the amount of solute remains constant (only solvent volume increases)
$M_iV_i=M_fV_f$

> How would you prepare $5.00\times10^2mL$ of a 1.75M $H_2SO_{4}$ solution starting with an 8.61M stock solution of $H_2SO_4$

> > 1. $MV=MV$ → $8.61V=500\times1.75$
> > 2. $V=102$ → amount of solvent added to a 500mL volumetric flask
> > 3. $500-102=398$ → amount of water added to the 500mL volumetric flask
