Relates the initial concentration $[A]_{0}$ of the reactants to the concentration, $[A]_{t}$ at a certain time point during the reaction.

$k$ is the rate constant as seen in [[instantaneous rate law of a reaction]].
- The units of $k$ determines whether it is a first, second, or third rate law.
- $k$ value is only affected by temperature and [[catalysts]] in a first rate law, but is affected by concentration in the second and third rate laws

Concentration does not have to be in [[molarity]].

The overall order of the reaction is the sum of the exponents.

Use this formula when time changes and you are asked to determine a final concentration.

## First order Rate Law
general: rate = $k[A]$
average: rate = $-\dfrac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}$

Then:
$-\dfrac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}$ = $k[A]$

Half Life:
$t_{1/2} = 0.693/k$
- Use this equation to find $k$ given a half life table, then solve for $[A]$ at different times by using the integrated first order rate law

### Integrated First order Rate Law
integrated rate law relates the initial concentration to the concentration at any time point
- $ln[A]_{t}=ln[A]_{0}-kt$
- Straight negative proportion between time and $ln[A]_{t}$ since $-k$ is the slope and $ln[A]_{0}$ is the y-intercept.
- Units for $k$ and $t$ has to be the same.

### Integrated Second order Rate Law
- $\frac{1}{[A]_{t}} = kt + \frac{1}{[A]_{0}}$
