Strong [[chemical bonding]] compared to [[pi bond]].
- This is because the greater the extent of overlapping, the higher the probability of finding the valence [[electron]]s in between the nuclei and hence the bond will be stronger & shorter.

head-on (axial) overlap of sigma bonds

2 s orbitals form sigma bonds.

Every single bond is 1 sigma bond
Every double bond is 1 sigma bond
Every triple bond is 1 sigma bond

Delocalized sigma bonds result from resonance structures since delocalized [[electron|electrons]] aren't confined to 2 atoms and can move around.
