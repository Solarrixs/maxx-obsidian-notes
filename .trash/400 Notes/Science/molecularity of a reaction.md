Is the number of molecules reacting in an elementary step
- Unimolecular: elementary step with 1 molecule - $k[A]$
- Bimolecular: elementary step with 2 molecules - $k[A][B]~or~k[A]^2$
- Termolecular: elementary step with 3 molecules - $k[A]^{3}$ or $k[A][B][C]$ or $k[A][B]^{2}$

Each elementary step has different [[rate of reaction]].

The elementary step with the slowest [[rate of reaction]] will ultimately determine the speed of the reaction (known as the rate-determining step). Therefore, the rate of the slowest [[rate of reaction]] is equal to the [[rate of reaction]] for the entire reaction.

- When the first elementary step is in equilibrium, its product must be substituted for.

> > In an equilibrium reaction, the rate for the forward reaction = the rate for the reverse reaction. Overall rate law is based on the slow step: $k_2\dfrac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[NO][Br_2][NO]$ = $k_{\mu}[NO]^2[Br_2]$
