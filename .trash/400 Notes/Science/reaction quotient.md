$Q_{c}$ is calculated by substituting the initial [[molarity]] concentrations of the reactants and products into the [[equilibrium constant]] expression.
- $Q_{c} < K_{c}$, system proceeds from to the right to reach [[equilibrium]]
- $Q_{c} = K_{c}$, system is at [[equilibrium]]
- $Q_{c} > K_{c}$, system proceeds to the left to reach [[equilibrium]]

So basically:

$$
Q_{c} = \frac{[A][D]}{[B][C]}
$$

- where A, B, C, D is the initial [[molarity]] concentration of the initial reactions. $A$ and $D$ are the products of the reaction.
- This is literally the exact thing as an [[homogenous equilibrium]] equation.
