Homogeneous mixture of 2+ substances. Solute is substance present in smaller amounts while solvent is the substance present in the large amount.
- ex [[metals#metal alloys|metal alloys]], the atmosphere

Electrolytic solutions are solutions that can conduct electricity.
- electrolytes are substances that can conduct electricity when dissolved in water. A non-electrolyte has the opposite effect.
- ex Molecular solutions produce non-electrolyte solutions. Ionic solutions produce either weak or strong electrolyte solutions.

Anything that dissolves in water must be polar.
- ex Thus, sugar (glucose, sucrose) and salt are polar since they are soluble in water.

The concentration of a solution can be calculated through [[molarity]].
