Related with [[acid and bases]].

$pH = -log[H+]$ or $pH = -\log[H_{3}O+]$
$pOH = -\log[OH^-]$
$pH + pOH = 14$

To find $pH$ or $pOH$ given a solubility equation, you need to find the concentration of either $[OH^-]$ or $[H^+]$, and use the formulas above.
- Only works with strong acids.

## Solubility in Acids
In an acidic solution, the acid needs to cause a shift to the right since those are where the soluble ions are found.

In the dissolution equation, the anions (ions with a negative charge) act as a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. A strong base will readily form [[acid (chemistry)|acids]], causing the [[equilibrium]] to shift to the right, which then reduces the concentration of the reactant, which overall increases the [[solubility]].

See: [[solubility for acids]]

### Problems
> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> The concentration of $H^+$ ions is $3.2 \times 10^{-4}M$. Later, the $H^+$ concentration becomes $1.0 \times 10^{-3}M$. Calculate the pH for both occasions.

> > 2. $-\log[1.0 \times 10^{-3}] = 3.0$.
