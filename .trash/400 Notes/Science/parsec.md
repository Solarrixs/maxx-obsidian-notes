Is a unit of length.

Symbol: pc

Used to measure large distances in astronomy outside of our [[solar system]].

Approximately equal to 3.26 [[light year]] or 206,000 [[astronomical unit|AU]].

The nearest star, [[Proxima Centauri]], is about 1.3 parsecs away from the [[sun]].

Parsecs are based on parallax measurements â€” periodic shifts in the apparent position of stars due to the Earth's motion around the Sun. This method to measure distances only works for (relatively) nearby stars.

The angle from the Earth to the unknown star is the parallax, which is also 1 [[arcsecond]].
