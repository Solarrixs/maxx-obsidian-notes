at constant volume and temperature, the total pressure of all gases in a container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the container.

$P_i=X_iP_T$
- Partial Pressure = Mole Fraction $\times$ Total Pressure

$X_{i}= \dfrac{n_i}{n_T}$
- Mole Fraction = Moles of Gas / Total Number of Moles

> [!help|c-pink dim]- Example
> A mixture of gas contains 4.46 moles of Ne, 0.74 moles of Ar, and 2.15 moles of Xe. Calculate the partial pressures of the gases if the total pressure is 2.00atm.

> > [!done|clean]- Answer
> > 1. Find mole fraction first. $\frac{moles \ of \ Ne}{total \ moles}=\frac{4.46}{7.35}=0.607$
> > 2. Multiply the mole fraction of that gas by the pressure. $0.607\times2=1.21atm$
