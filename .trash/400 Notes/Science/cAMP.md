Is a secondary messenger.
Activated by Gs [[GPCR]]s Alpha+GTP subunits and created by [[adenylyl cyclase]].

cAMP activates the cAMP dependent [[protein kinase A]], which phosphorylates and thus mediates various cellular functions:
- Transport proteins
- Metabolic enzymes
- Transcription factors
- Structural proteins

When the activation signal is removed and [[adenylyl cyclase]] is inhibited, cAMP is broken down by the enzyme phosphodiesterase into AMP and inhibits protein kinase A.
