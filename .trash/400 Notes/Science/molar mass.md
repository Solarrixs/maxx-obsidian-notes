Molar mass is given on the [[trends of the periodic table|periodic table]].
- This represents the average mass for a mole of all the isotopes of an element, weighted by percent abundance

Can be found by adding the sum of the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] for an element.
- [[electron|electrons]] are not counted in the mass because they have minimal mass
