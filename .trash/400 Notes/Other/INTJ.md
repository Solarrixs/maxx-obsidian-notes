## Socials and Friendships
INTJs are generally stick to quieter and less crowded areas at social events and are considered "private people". They also often feel like they don't belong in social situations. To people they know (*and like*), they can be quite talkative, except when talking about their own feelings and emotions, as they think of themselves as objective and not emotional. As such, most INTJs believe they "listen to their head rather than their heart when it comes to making important choices." Usually talks less under stressful conversations or scenarios.

INTJs oftentimes come up as too blunt, which stems from the fact that INTJs believe that the truth is more important than sugarcoating someone else's feelings. Usually, they don't mean to be aggressive, they just want to get the truth out. Social graces and manners also don't mean much to Architects: they aren't bothered if someone doesn't like them, and might even annoy people intentionally for fun (especially if they dislike them). Furthermore, INTJs believe that respect must be earned rather than given by default, so INTJs might be pretty harsh and disrespectful when you first meet them. Most INTJs show a distinct lack of regard for others’ sensibilities - they look after themselves first and other people come second.

Most INTJs report that spending time by themselves often ends up more interesting and satisfying than the time they spend with other people (again, they are private people). This doesn't mean they don't enjoy social events - but they really only enjoy smaller events among friends they know and like, because they typically like situations that allows them to make decisions that give the more control in their life.

Speaking about friendships, INTJs have a desire to surround themselves with people who really understand them and share similar values as they do. INTJs mainly focus on the other person’s intellect rather than their looks, social skills, or other characteristics, far more than any other type. Otherwise, they do not consider them true friends. They find it difficult to relate to people who let their emotions guide them, or those who aren't driven by something.

INTJs are not concerned about helping others, and are the most likely personality type to have no obligation to help others, even if others have helped them before. Whenever they do help others, they have underlying personal reasons to or have a desire to create or maintain a friendship with that person.

## Relationships
Typically, INTJs reject traditional gender roles in their relationships. For example, most INTJs prefer themselves to clean and keep order in a home, as a neat and clean home is usually a top priority.. INTJs generally like symmetry and angles, and organize to create efficiency. They also typically make decisions that give the more control than excitement in life.

INTJs typically do everything they can to avoid crying in front of others, as they strongly fear looking weak. This also leads them to not ask for help.

## Personal Values
INTJs *strongly* desire independence, and hate relying or depending on others. INTJs desire figuring things out for themselves (they don't trust people of authority: 2nd most likely type to believe that figures in authority are not to be trusted). This might stem from the fact that INTJs believe that themselves are the only ones reliable and knowledgeable enough to make decisions for themselves; thus, the best way to ensure that something is done properly is to do it themselves.

When leading others, INTJs follow the same mentality: they are the only ones reliable and knowledgeable enough to make decisions for themselves and prefer to give rather than take orders. Therefore, INTJs often lead with a firm hand (authoritarian over democratic leadership) to maintain control of decisions, and sometimes trample over those who are weaker-willed. INTJs also believe that most people in power do not deserve to be there, yet also believe that they are capable to be in a position of power.

INTJs find it difficult to accept imperfection, topping the list of all personality types. Imperfection comes from both themselves and other people. This leads to their conscious efforts to desire independence driven by self-doubt and a strong fear of failure. This also leads them to believe that they should lead, as they believe they are the knowledgeable and reliable. Architects don’t really trust others, but they do trust themselves. They do not shy away from taking leadership roles, if necessary. Even if they don’t want to lead, they accept leadership just to save society from its own blunders.

INTJs are mainly driven by their relentless quest towards self-improvement and satisfying their curiosity through learning. Oftentimes, this results in them directing a lot of their attention toward personal interests and hobbies (which often times are educational or meaningful in some way). They also work extremely hard to get their anxieties and worries under control.

## Random Facts
INTJs can "read the room" and other people's emotions relatively accurately, although this heavily depends on the specific INTJ.

In certain scenarios, INTJs strongly prefer to act anonymously and influencing the actions of others to achieve their goals.

INTJs believe a healthy amount of stress and worrying would lead to better results, and are more likely to thrive under stress.

Typically extremely wary of people and have little faith in people: takes a long time to open up their feelings and emotions.

Believe that morality is something people have made up and is not a concrete idea.

## Downsides
INTJs often generate a lot of ideas but few of them ever comes to life. Perhaps forming good friendships as a team can help accomplish more goals.

INTJs are too blunt/honest in certain situations, leading to bad first impressions.

INTJs tend to look after themselves foremost, and believe others are incompetent unless skills are demonstrated. Can be difficult to work with in a team, as they might be too controlling and easily annoyed by imperfection.

## Success
Personality type seems to play a role in how different types define and pursue ideas of success.

In particular, INTJs believe that financial wealth is an indicator of life success, and the more successful they are, the more likely they are to be happy. As INTJs are strategically minded planners, they were the third most likely type (87%) to agree that they spent a lot of time thinking about success.

However, they don't feel as if other people played a significant role in their success. INTJs are the most likely to agree that they are individually responsible for their suggests (62%).
