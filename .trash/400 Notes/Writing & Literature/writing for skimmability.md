- '' Formatting is the easiest 10x you can make in your writing.
- '' Readers do not read linearly on the Internet. They jump around. They look for the next-easiest section to fly through.

## Start Every Section with a Single-sentence Opener
Start every section with a single-sentence opener. open your piece (and every subsequent section) with a single sentence.

- Open with 1 strong, declarative sentence.
- Open with a thought-provoking question.
- Open with a controversial opinion.
- Open with a moment in time.
- Open with a vulnerable statement.
- Open with a weird, unique insight.

Then add a space between the first sentence and the rest of the body.

## Bulleted Lists > Paragraphs
Your goal is for them to consume your work, and to not waste any of their time. Use lists as much as possible.

## Subheads
Subheads are bolded sentences throughout a piece that help the reader know "where" they are in your line of thinking.

- Split the page evenly visually to create symmetry
- Add enough splitting to give readers milestones to reach every time they scroll.

## Use the 1/3/1 Writing Rhythm
alternate length of sentences and sectionsâ€”ideally opening and closing each section with a single sentence.

so traditionally, you will have a paragraph
Use the above rules to turn the opening and closing into a single sentence (1)
Turn the body (3, 4, etc) into bullets if possible
separate the opening, closing, and body
use a subhead to jump to the next section

## Styling
break writing into short, easy to read sentences
have a fast rate of revelation that provides new info for the reader
use transition words to connect ideas
