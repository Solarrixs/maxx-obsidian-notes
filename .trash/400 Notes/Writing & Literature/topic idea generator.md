List all of the problems I've solved and topics I've learned about over the last 2 years?

Group into topics and narrow down to 3 topics.

Take your topics and add a level of specificity that makes the audience you're writing to the same person you were 2 years ago before you solved the problem.
- add "for..." then specify industry, demographics, physical location, digital platform, price, distribution, problem

Use the [[4A writing framework]] to write headlines.

Pick 3 ideas to write about, once a day.
