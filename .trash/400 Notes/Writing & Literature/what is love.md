## Biological
Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food.

## Definition
A feeling of strong or constant affection for a person

## Philosophical
There are many ideas of love:

- According to Kurt Vonnegut in *The Sirens of Titan*:

> A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved

- According to Anais Nin in *A Literate Passion*:

> What is love, but the acceptance of the other, whatever he is?

- Stendhal’s *1822 Treatise on Love*:

> Love is like a fever which comes and goes… no age limits for love

None really state whether love is bad; they simply try to define love and morph it into a tangible idea, but this quote from C.S. Lewis in *The Four Loves* dives deeper:

>   To make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart (and therefore, love) to no one. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and luxuries, avoid entanglements… the only place where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers of love is Hell.

So Lewis acknowledges that love is dangerous - essentially it’s better to not love than to love and be broken by love. This raises another philosophical question that is yet to be answered.
Also, Lewis seems to uphold a nihilistic view of love and life.

- Charles Bukowski quotes:

> Love is like a fog in the morning. It’s just a little while, then burns away with the first daylight of reality.

Another pessimistic outlook on love.

- A famous line in Shakespeare’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*:

> Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.

So is love the abstract or the physical? Is it pertaining to the mind or the body of a person? Clearly, Shakespeare leans toward the former: a love of one’s mind could be classified as a different type of love than a love of one’s body… right?

- Katherine Hepburn in *Me: Stories of My Life*:

> Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get but with what you are expecting to give.

Is love simply an expression of human altruism? Is love primarily altruistic, and how so?

- James Baldwin in *The Price of the Ticket: Collected Non-fiction*:

> Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war, love is a growing up.

Here, Baldwin is referencing that love is similar to a war, and the battles within the war make up the state of love. Definition of War: a situation or a period of fighting between two entities, whether that be countries or people. Involving the use of force and power - usually leading to armed conflicts. According to Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*, war is a necessary evil - intrinsic among human nature.

- Haruki Murakami’s *Kafka on the Shore*:

> Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves.

Is love merely trying to find the missing pieces of yourself? Then is love truly and actually an altruistic behavior? What if love is simply the embodiment of selfishness within humanity that keeps us going on with our needs? Is it a way for us to escape from realities.

From these sources, love is, ultimately described, purely abstract and difficult to understand. Love is unique, like every individual is unique in their own way. Therefore, is there a viable reasoning or generalization of love?

Generally, many sources claim that there are no age limits for love, but is there really only one definition of love as the previous sources claim there to be: human love? Are there different types of love?

## Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love
- Sternberg states that in the context of interpersonal relationships, 3 components of love are the:
	1. ***Intimacy*** → refers to the feelings of *closeness* and *bonding* in loving relationships. This creates the feeling of being at ease with each other - characterized by a personal and private nature.
	2. ***Passion*** → drives that lead to *romance* and physical *attraction*. Can be associated with either *physical arousal* or *emotional stimulation*, such as enthusiasm and a strong sexual feeling for someone.
	3. ***Decision*** & ***Commitment*** → the decision and commitment to maintain love. Unlike the other two, it is a *conscious* decision to stick with a partner and mainly determined by the level of satisfaction that a partner derives from the relationship. Can be thought of as loyalty or the willingness to work hard to support the relationship with your partner.

- They intersect, originating at the vertices of a triangle, interact to form 7 different kinds of love experiences. The absolute strength of each vertex determines the amount of love that one experiences, and the relative strength of each vertex determines the type of love one experiences.
	- A relationship based solely on a single vertex is weaker than one with an absolute strength in multiple vertices.

### Earlier Theories Consolidated by Sternberg
- The Triangular Theory of Love is influenced by multiple earlier theories:
	1. ***The Theory of Liking vs. Loving*** → the difference between *liking* and *loving* are due to three main elements: *attachment, caring, and intimacy*.
	2. ***The Color Wheel Model of Love*** → three major styles of love: *Eros, Ludos, and Storage*. These three styles, although distinct, can be combined to form secondary forms of love, similar to a color wheel.

### Multiple Identifications of Love
- They also differentiate between two identifications of love: *passionate love*, which is focused on the present onset of a relationship and *companionate love*, which is love that endures challenges and compounds over time with deep meanings in that relationship.
	- *Passionate Love* → Strong feelings of love, desire for a specific person, excitement and novelty. Primarily in the beginning of a relationship and lasts 3-12 months.Biologically, those experiencing passionate love release greater concentrations of phenylethylamine and oxytocin.
	- *Companionate Love* → Known as affectionate love. When a couple progresses from Passionate Love to Companionate Love, a couple feels mutual understanding and care for each other. This type of love is essential for the survival of a relationship.

## There’s No Such Thing as Everlasting Love (Emily Esfahani Smith)
- Emotions happen in “micro-moments of positivity resonance,” shared with another, according to psychologist Barbara Fredrickson.
	- Essentially: love isn’t a sustainable emotion but rather a connection characterized by a flood of positive emotions, in which you share with another person. The person can be anyone – romantic partners, child, close friends, parents, and even strangers, colleagues, etc.
- This type of love suggests that love is not explicit for one person – we can pour our love into a multitude of different factors. We can love our pets, our environment, or our hobbies, but that type of love is strictly distinct from the love we are normally associating it with: I’ll call it bonding or affectionate love. In reality, this condition of love is quite sparse, correlating with the fact that 20% of individuals at any given time will feel sufficiently lonely for it to be a major source of unhappiness in their lives. Furthermore, the scarcity of this type of love has resulted in higher rates of depression, with it being 10 times more prevalent now than it was around 50 years ago, according to the CDC.
	- With this information, Fredrickson argues that the people who have fixed their mindset that love is defined by having a romantic partner that would contribute greatly to their happiness actually limits the apparent benefits of health and happiness that you normally derive from love.
- A Simplistic Generalization:
	1. Love isn’t exclusive and does not belong to one person.
	2. Making eye contact is essential to creating the gateway for love.
	3. Small emotional moments can have a disproportionately large biological effects.
	4. Don’t take a loving marriage for granted.
	5. Changing and humbling your view of love can change your experiences and capacity for it.

### Biological Basis of Love
- Unlike other positive emotions, such as joy or happiness, love cannot be kindled individually. It can only manifest through physical connections between two people.
- This is influenced by mirror neurons, oxytocin, and vagal tone, which contributes to the micro-moment of positivity resonance that Fredrickson calls love.
	- Oxytocin, a hormone, is released during moments of intimate connections, which spikes the attachment and bonding that one feels during moments of connections.
	- Essentially, love is facilitated by shared physical connections with moments of “inside-moments,” allowing for oxytocin release and intimacy.

## Levels of Love (Martin Luther King Jr)
- Love isn’t just a singular type of pattern but rather there are many levels of love.
- Utilitarian love: love at the lowest level.
	- One loves for the usefulness to him. The individual loves that person that he can use. Friendship is generally based on this level of love.
	- They see other people as mere steps by which they can climb to their personal ends and ambition.
	- When they discover that they can’t use those persons, they lose the love and affection that they once had for them.
	- This love is based on true selfishness and it ends up depersonalizing people by relegating people to the status of things. This is always a form of conditional love, and not the pure form of unconditional love.
- Real love: meaningful love – seen as romantic love. It rises above utilitarian love as it is characterized by a degree of altruism, for a person who really loves with true romantic love will do anything to satisfy the object of that love.
	- This type of love can be found in Romeo and Juliet.
	- However, it also contains a degree of selfishness as there is something about a person that attracts you.
- Philio love, or true friendship love. It is love on a higher level as the scope of it is broader and more inclusive. While romantic love is 2 individuals, friendship love can include same genders, and more than 2 individuals, while jealously emerges in a type of romantic love when more than 2 individuals are involved.
- Humanitarian love is even more broad and inclusive than Philo love, as it is an individual that loves humanity as a whole – within every individual, there is something sacred and loved among them.

## Loving Your Enemies (Martin Luther King Jr)
- The ultimate form of love is the ability to love other’s for their hate of you. This is a strength of a strong faith in Christian as you have the ability to cut the chains of hate that entrails all of humanity.
- Hatred destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater. The more we hate, the more we develop guilt feelings and suppress certain emotions, causing tragic, neurotic responses.
- Love has the power to transform those who hate, while mutual hatred would only lead to the destruction of both parties.

## The Art of Loving (Erich From)
- Love requires knowledge and effort to be successful.
- A lot of people are starved for love yet most people place love below other ideals such as money, power, fame, etc.
- Love is almost like a buying or trading of useful commodities of qualities in another person, such as trading sex appeal or appearances – it’s a mixture between popular and having sex appeal.
	- A nice package of qualities which are popular and sought after on the personality matter can change depending on each individual and time. Attractive women used to be tough and smoking and drinking, but now attractive women demands traits of domesticity and coyness.
	- Two persons thus fall in love when they feel they have found the best object available on the market, considering the limitations of their own exchange values.
- There is hardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started with such tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet, which fails so regularly, as love.
- In spite of the deep-seated craving for love, almost everything else is considered to be more important than love: success, prestige, money, power - almost all our energy is used for the learning of how to achieve these aims, and almost none to learn of art loving.
- Could it be that only those things are considered worthy of being learned with which one can earn money or prestige, and that love, which "only " profits the soul, but is profitless in the modern sense, is a luxury we have no right to spend much energy on?
