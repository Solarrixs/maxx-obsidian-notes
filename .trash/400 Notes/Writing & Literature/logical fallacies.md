During a debate, logical fallacies are often used, either on purpose or on accident. This siphons off value from [[the true purpose of debate]].

## Strawman Fallacy
 - Argument simplified to make it easier to argue against
 - Might be constructed when you don’t understand the depth of the argument
 - Ignore information and exaggeration of points

## Ad Hominem
 - When you argue with the person, they argue against you and not the argument
 - Makes person defend themselves and not their argument

## Black and White Fallacy
 - Presents limited options even though there is more options

## Authority Fallacy
 - Because they’re in an authoritative position, they generally have better knowledge and are thus right → fallacy
 - Doesn’t apply to scientists who do research or people are actually qualified to say this claim

## No True Scotsman Fallacy
 - Basing something or what degree does something truly belong to a certain description or group
 - “No true … would ever say that thing: thus if you say this then you are not the…”

## Bandwagon Fallacy
 - When the argument was that everyone does something but that doesn’t mean that it is right

## Appeal to Emotion
 - Appeal to emotion to accept a conclusion by making them feel sorry for someone or another emotion
 - Similar to Pathos

## Bad Analogy
 - Fallacy assuming that 2 things are similar in some aspects, then they are similar in other aspects
