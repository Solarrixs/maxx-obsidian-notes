## 4A Framework
1. take a topic and pick a direction: actionable (here's how), analytical (numbers), aspiration (yes, you can), anthropological (here's why)
	1. actionable: tips, hacks, resources, guides
	2. analytical: trends, numbers, fact based
	3. aspirational: lessons, mistakes, reflections, how to get started, what you would do again
	4. anthropological: fears, failures, struggles
2. choose an approach for your topic (how to, lessons learned, mistakes)
3. leverage reader credibility (explain why you're the expert, source another real expert, or share personal experience)
