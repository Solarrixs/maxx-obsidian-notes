## Writing Styles

### Grease-Slide
- Set the stage for your reader and give them a mental picture of where you are headed.
- Connect with your reader by showing empathy and understanding their emotions. (It's not easy to X, We know it's tough to Y, Perhaps you’ve tried Z.)
- Use transitional phrases or questions to get the reader to the next point of action. (Let’s dive in!, But, And the best part?)

### Problem, Agitate, Solution
- identify a problem that the target reader is facing (pain point, challenge, unfulfilled need)
- agitate the problem by highlighting negative consequences of not solving it. create urgency and a feeling of "needing to take action"
- offer a solution that address the problem and solves it. it has to be clear, actionable, and easy to understand.

### Hooks
- Raise a question without giving away the answer: Leave the reader wanting to know more. Motivate them to engage and seek out further information. (Can you explain...; Have you ever wondered...; What's the story behind?)
- Highlight the accolades of a story without offering the reason why: Create a sense of curiosity and anticipation. Prompt the reader to seek out the reason behind the achievement and engage with the story. (The reason why is not what you might expect…)
- Show a common problem without providing the solution: Create a sense of empathy and understanding, highlight a shared experience and prompt people to seek out solutions and alternatives. (You're not alone if you've experienced...)
