You don't need to create content, just curate content but borrow credibility:
1. Cite someone else directly
2. Curate broad content without citing
3. Quote or use a metaphor

## Lead in Tweet
introduce readers to your writing
it'll be a hook to get people to read on
use WHO, WHAT, WHY (what promise are you making for the reader)

### Story
here's the end result of the story
here's how it started
read on to find out the progression

### Framework
main premise of the framework
bullet points of the framework
explanation in 1 paragraph that PROMISES something to the reader

### Actionable Takeaways
main premise of the takeaways
short story introducing the takeaway
hook to your takeaway
say something like "I use these x templates every time."

## Twitter Threads
give each tweet a mini headline
use bullets
use 1/3/1 framework

the 2nd to last twitter thread should be a call to action to follow you and continue reading your best stuff

the last twitter thread should be a TLDR - compress everything you've written
