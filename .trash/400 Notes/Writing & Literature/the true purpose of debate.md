A debate is a form of public discourse, or simply: a discussion among multiple people about an idea with *differing* views. Naturally, groups will form based on the sides that people take in an argument, but is the point of a debate merely to argue with each other? What should the outcome of a debate lead to?

Many people will hold onto their ideas without letting go, ignoring other information and refusing to acknowledge the other side. This is a classic example of [[Psychological Fixation|psychological fixation]] or [[Belief Perseverance|belief perseverance]]. This is not a debate, as nothing is gained from either parties.

In a debate, you should *constantly seek to understand new information* and *different perspectives* to help **guide your own judgement**. In effect, a debate should counter the [[confirmation bias|confirmation bias effect]] and allow you to **grow in knowledge**. While sometimes you will maintain your current stance on a subject, more often than not, a proper debate should add some qualifiers to your stance – otherwise, it demonstrates that either you have already rationalized why your opponent’s belief doesn’t sit well with you or you are subject to the [[confirmation bias]] effect.
