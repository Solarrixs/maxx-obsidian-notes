the [[house of representatives]] rules committees are super powerful since virtually all bills within the [[house of representatives]] must go through the rules committee at one point.

The Rules Committee essentially assigns a rule (ticket) to every bill and establish the time allowed for debate.

## Types of Rules
1. Open Rule: amendments can be made to a bill from the floor but they must be germane.
	- A way to sabotage a bill since there are so many opinions from all the different House members, which will run down the clock.
2. Closed Rule: no amendments except those associated with mark-up.
3. Modified/Restrictive: permits only certain types of amendments to a bill.
4. Special Rule: Used to fast track legislation by manipulating typical processes. It would bypass regular order and the [[congress rules committees|House Rules Committee]] can dominate the process and speed up passing.

## Ways to Bypass the Rules Committee
1. Suspend the rules by a 2/3 majority.
	- This allows one to edit the debate time and housekeeping rules. If there is tremendous support for a bill, a bill with the majority will suspend the rules and pass very quickly.
2. Discharge Petition: A bill with 218 signatures can force the floor to debate and vote on the bill. This ensures that the committee cannot keep a bill stuck within the committee.
	- This goes against the majority leadership, typically by the minority party.
