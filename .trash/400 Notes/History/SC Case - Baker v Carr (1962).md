one of the most contentious [[supreme court]] case ever that decided that courts can decide on apportionment due to the Equal Protection Clause of the [[amendment#14th amendment]].

Baker is a black [[republicans|republican]] from the South. When Baker sees the legislative districts in his state, he realizes that the appointment of some states are different from other states. Typically, state districts are remade every 10 years but Baker's state hasn't remade a state district since the early 1900s.

Also in the 1960s, the rural to city migration is beginning to kick off, and there are a lot of cities with rapidly expanding populations. However, due to the lack of legislature reappointment, there were a lot of legislatures for rural areas with less populations compared to city areas with greater populations.

The main question was: can the courts rule on apportionment cases which have been viewed as political questions? Since the people decided and voted for state legislatures who apportioned the state, the court has no say nor methodology to determine what is the ideal congressional district.
