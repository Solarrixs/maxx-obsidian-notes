The elected official makes decisions based upon how the majority of their constituents would decide on a particular matter.

However, oftentimes, people target their decisions based on the majority of people who voted for that person (see: [[plurality vote]])
- For example, someone who has a lot of votes from women will target their laws to keep women voting for them, even if they don't make up the majority.
