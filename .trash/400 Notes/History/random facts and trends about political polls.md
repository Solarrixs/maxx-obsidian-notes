The best presidential approval rating is 47% or higher.

The direction of the country is usually on the wrong track with an average of 60% of Americans. This is largely driven by the economy, such as fuel prices, [[inflation]], food prices, etc.

Republicans also doesn't really show up at voting polls, but they still vote anyways. This can affect the results of polls.

Even though midterm elections don't concern presidential elections, the president still plays a heavy role in whether people vote Democrat or Republican.
- This is a prime example of the [[coattail effect]].

In a generic poll, people ask whether they would vote for Democrat or Republican in general. In history, [[democrats]] poll higher (by around 6 points higher) on the generic polls. This is because there is a natural tendency for people who doesn't know anything about politics to associate with the Democratic party because it is associated with democracy.

As election day comes closer, the gap between democrats and [[republicans]] closes and becomes tighter as more people become focused on the elections.

In the summer time, people are relaxed while during the school year, people are focused on governmental issues. Thus, they become more focused on elections and tend to result in democrats losing public support.
