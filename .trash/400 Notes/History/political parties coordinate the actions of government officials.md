[[political parties]] prevent elected officials from doing whatever they want at random, allowing officials to work together on certain things and create a common agenda that is to be the priority.
- Elected officials are not forced to work with each other due to separation of powers.
- ex This allows people from Congress, Governors, and State Officials to work together on what the political parties want. Most officials therefore follow the agenda of the president.
