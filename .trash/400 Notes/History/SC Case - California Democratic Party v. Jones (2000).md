A [[supreme court]] case regarding [[political primary#blanket primary]].

Californians are heavily [[democrats]], so democrats had a huge advantage in primaries, which allowed people to raid the republican primaries.

The [[supreme court]] eventually ruled that blanket primaries are unconstitutional since it violates free association under the [[amendment#1st amendment]].
