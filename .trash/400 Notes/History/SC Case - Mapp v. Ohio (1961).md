A [[supreme court]] case.

Police wants to look around in Mapp's house without a warrant, and convicts her on the charge of possessing pornography.

The Court decides that Mapp's [[amendment#4th amendment]] was violated and declares that states cannot disregard unreasonable searches and seizures.

This is an example the [[selective incorporation doctrine]] applying to the [[amendment#4th amendment]].

This creates the [[exclusionary rule for searches]].
