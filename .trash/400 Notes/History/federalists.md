The federalists were confident in the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] because it allowed states to retain some power. The whole point of a central [[government]] is to be able to have an army to protect the states and proper taxation to pay off debts and improve the economy, but not enough power to overrule state powers.

Included [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and John Jay, who wrote the [[federalist papers]] in response to the [[anti-federalists]]'s [[brutus no. 1]].

The federalists are generally opposed the [[bill of rights]].
