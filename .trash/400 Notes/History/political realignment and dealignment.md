## Types of Realignments
1. when one party disappears and another comes to existence
2. when people switch parties (especially during a [[critical election]])
3. when a region changes in terms of the party they identify with

## The History of US Realignments
1. creation of the Democratic Republicans under [[Thomas Jefferson]] against the [[federalists]] in the 1800s
2. creation of a modern Democratic Party under [[Andrew Jackson]] and the Whigs in 1828, eventually leading to the Know Nothings American party and Free Soil party
3. creation of the Republican party in 1860
4. the [[critical election]] between [[William Bryan]] and McKinley in 1896 led the southern republicans to move into the democratic party in huge numbers while northern democrats move into the republican party. The South becomes a "solid south" of democrats while the North still held competitive elections
5. the [[critical election]] between Roosevelt and Hoover in 1932 led blacks, women and unions to move into the democratic party.

## Electoral Realignment
When there is **long lasting** changes in the coalitions that make up a [[political parties]].
- A coalition a group of people that support a political party. For example, [[democrats]] rely extremely heavily on their coalitions, which include higher educated people, blacks, hispanics, people opposed to guns, etc

## Regional Realignment
When regions of the US as a coalition shift between [[political parties]].
- ex white southerners moving toward the [[republicans|republican]] party both locally and nationally in recent history (approximately the 1950s). By the election of 1968 and onwards, Nixon and other state level officials had the support of the white southerners who had shifted to become republicans.
- Social issues because of the Culture War led white southerners to shift from liberal democrats to become conservative republicans as the Culture War went against judaeo Christian values.
- ? Could this be an example of a [[critical election]]?

## Political Dealignment
When voters no longer identify with a party. This leads to the rise of pseudo independent voters, especially during the 1960s following the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam. But most people still lean towards a specific party.

True independent voters don't associate with a party and regularly switch between parties. These type of people are small in population but are heavily influential in who wins the party.

## Split and Straight Ticket Voting
Straight ticket voting is only voting for a certain party
- ex Prominent during the age of political machines
Split ticket voting is voting for different parties for different type of election races
- ex Political dealignment causes more split ticket voting.

## Coat-tail Effect
When the top of the ticket (the president) has strong public support and lends people to support lower ticket races where a candidate is of the same party.
- This effect is weakened by split ticket voting if people vote for different parties.
