Reconciliation can only be used on very specific budgetary matters in the [[senate]]. This makes [[filibuster|filibusters]] not allowed to be used and ensures no [[riders (legislative)]] can be put on the legislation.

Only a simple majority vote is needed. Reconciliation is only supposed to be used once a year as well.
- ex Affordable Care Act, [[inflation]] Reduction Act, Tax Reform, American Rescue Plan
- This allows a party to passes a very controversial piece of legislation with just a majority of the supporting party. The other party is ignored essentially.
- '' The fact that all big legislation was made through reconciliation shows the breakdown of cooperation between the [[democrats]] and [[republicans]]
