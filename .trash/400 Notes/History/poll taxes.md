This was part of the [[Jim Crow laws]]. About 5 states implemented this policy.

It stated that to vote, taxes must be paid. This meant that many poor blacks couldn't vote, along with poor people in general. This **wasn't exclusive** to the black community.

The [[amendment#24th amendment|24th Amendment]] in 1964 eliminates poll taxes for national elections (presidents, vice-presidents, senators, and representatives).
- This followed the concept of [[dual federalism]] as the powers of the states and federal [[government]] were separated. It allowed poll taxes for state elections since it was within the sphere of domain for [[reserved powers]].

In the [[SC Case - Harper v. Virginia (1966)]] [[supreme court]] decision, they declared that poll taxes aren't unconstitutional at the state level as it violated the [[amendment#14th amendment|14th Amendment]]. This followed the concept of [[cooperative federalism]] as the SC enforced the removal of poll taxes even among state elections.
