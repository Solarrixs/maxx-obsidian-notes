Is an [[independent regulatory commissions]] created by the [[Communications Act of 1934]]. This replaces the [[Radio Act of 1927]] and is the main document that governs communication laws. All new laws regarding communication are typically amended into the Communications Act of 1934, such as section 230.

Consists of 5 members with no more than 3 from one party. Serve 5 year terms which the [[US president|President]] appoints and the [[senate]] confirms. These members regulate radio, wire, satellite, cable, and TV **(but not print)** by promoting competition, innovation, and investment.
- Internet can also be regulated since internet originates from wire, satellites, and cable.
- Internet and social media companies are not allowed to be sued on the basis of what is said on it. This promotes the innovation of internet companies, and thus promotes competition, therefore companies don't get sued to death whenever something happens on their site.
- Media requires licensing. Therefore, the FCC can remove and give licenses depending on whether regulation are being followed or not.

If one wants to have a license for media, the FCC will take into other account your forms of media to ensure that one company doesn't control a majority of the media market within a certain area. This can technically affect newspapers since the FCC won't allow a single company to dominate the media in an area.

## Regulations of the FCC
1. Equal Time Rule: if a politician is broadcast on a program, the challenger must be given time to respond and therefore are allowed to have airtime from the same media form. This was an attempt for the FCC to carry over good journalistic policies to media.
	1. & However, [[congress]] creates exemptions for the Equal Time Rule for regular news, on the spot news, documentary and debates in 1959. This is because incumbent Senators held a huge advantage in gaining re-election due to their access to media. So it was in all of their interests to prevent new and upcoming Senators from accessing the Equal Time Rule. Thus, the Equal Time Rule is a shell of what it once was in this regard.
	2. & If advertising space is sold to a political candidate, broadcasters can't prevent the opposing political candidate from advertising. This usually doesn't do anything since the media wants to make money anyways so they'll buy up as many ad space as possible.
2. Right of Rebuttal (Personal Attack) Rule: if a person is attacked on a broadcast, that person must be given time to respond, unless it is a regular news program. **Is overturned**
3. Political Editorializing Rule: if a broadcaster endorses a candidate, the other side must get time to respond. **Is overturned**
	1. & In the Radio, TV, News Association v. FCC (2000), the media [[political interest groups]] sued the FCC. The US Court of Appeals overturns the Right of Rebuttal Rule and Political Editorializing Rule as the FCC had no justification for why these 2 laws were necessary. Due to the expansion of media outlets, these rules do not really make sense anymore.
4. Fairness Doctrine (1949-1987): any controversial issue or issue of public importance must cover all sides, instead of picking a side to cover.
	1. & However, the FCC unilaterally abolishes the Fairness Doctrine with the 3 [[republicans]] voting for it. The 2 [[democrats]] on the board of FCC did not want it to be abolished. [[congress]] under the [[democrats]] tried to force reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine but was vetoed by Reagan and Bush. This resulted in a super biased media and allowed for the birth of many conservative talk radio or partisan political programs on TV.
	2. & In modern era, the massive amount of media access makes this doctrine somewhat redundant, as it is almost guaranteed that there are different sides to a story.

	Regulation of media content has greatly decreased since the early 1900s due to the gutting of the various regulations of the FCC, such as the right of rebuttal and political editorializing rule.
