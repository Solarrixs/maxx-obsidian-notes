Lopez is a high school senior who brought a gun to school, and was thus arrested.
The federal police interfere and claim that Lopez broke federal law by bringing a gun near a school.

The question was, does the gun free school zone act exceed the authority of [[congress]] to justify legislation by way of the [[interstate commerce clause]]?

Some [[supreme court]] justices argued that the gun or any part of the gun was made from a different state, and thus it was interstate commerce, but ultimately a 5-4 decision led to the conclusion that a gun on school property is not an economic activity that would have a significant impact on economic activity and interstate commerce.
