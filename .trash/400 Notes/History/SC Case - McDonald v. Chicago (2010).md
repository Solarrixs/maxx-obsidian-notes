A [[supreme court]] case.

Some states heavily regulate the ability to own guns. Chicago doesn't allow McDonald to get handguns (but can get rifles and shotguns).

The court decides that cities and states must allow people to have a right to self defense rooted in the [[amendment#2nd amendment]] by way of the due process clause of the [[amendment#14th amendment]].

This is an example of [[selective incorporation doctrine]] enforcing the constitutionality of the 2nd amendment.
