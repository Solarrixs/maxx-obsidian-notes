## The Judiciary Branch
This was written by [[Alexander Hamilton]] to examine the [[judicial branch]] of the US [[government]]. The [[anti-federalists]] are too concerned about the the judicial branch, claiming they lack accountability and are too independent.

The document focused on three major points:
1. Appointing [[federal judges]]: appointed by the [[US president|president]] (according to Article II of the [[constitution (US)]]), confirmed by the [[senate]].
2. The tenure of federal judges to hold their places: lifetime services or good behavior.
3. The division of different courts and their relations

The [[judicial branch]] is the least powerful of the three branches of government as it cannot command the army nor have control over the purse (money), and does not have the force to enforce something.

The separation of the [[judicial branch]] through lifetime service is also essential to ensure proper functioning of the courts in determining whether the legislation passed by [[congress]] is constitutional or not through judicial review. This makes the justices independent from the other two branches or dependent upon the masses. Lifetime appointments will also ensure that the best justices will serve and have the time to know more about the functions of the court rather than rapid re-elections replacing seasoned justices with inexperienced ones.

Finally, having a [[judicial branch]] will safeguard against the [[tyranny of the majority]].
