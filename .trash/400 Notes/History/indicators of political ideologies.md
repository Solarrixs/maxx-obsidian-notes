Families can heavily influence a child's [[political ideology]] but this is hard to track as an indicator.

[[political polls]] can also reveal the political ideologies of the general people.

## Religion
Religion can heavily influence political ideologies.

Catholics are socially [[conservatives|conservative]] and economically [[liberals|liberal]] and is thus similar to populism. Catholic votes are very important in elections since they make up a large proportion of America's population. A devout Catholic favor social issues but less devout Catholics favor economic issues.

Jews are overwhelming very liberal but orthodox Jews (they are very not secular) are conservative. They mostly vote for the [[democrats|democratic]] party but there are very little Jews in the US population, however, they have a lot of money that can fund democrats and are very popular on media, allowing them to reach a wide audience. Thus, Jews have a disproportionate amount of influence. The more separated one is from orthodox Jews, the more they believe in secularism.

Protestantism (people who aren't Christian but still religious). Mainline Protestants are historically conservative but recently they are socially and economically mixed in both conservatism and liberalism. A lot of the Protestants are becoming more secular and causes a rift, leading to the Culture War.

Evangelical Christians/fundamentalist Christians is the fastest growing religious group in the US. Are heavily conservative both socially and economically. This is a huge population group and make up the base of the [[republicans|republican]] party and have huge voting power. They believe that individuals must take personal responsibility for the poor around them and cannot pass the responsibility off to the government.

## Gender
The gender gap is the percent difference between women and men regarding their views on political issues - a gap between how men and women vote on the same issue.

Smaller gender gap should favor the republican party while a large gender gap should favor the democratic party.
- ? how? why?

Women are significantly more liberal than men. Single women, who are most likely very young, widows or divorced, are major contributors and thus creators to the gender gap. Married women typically think differently from single women, as single women are not economically secure and would support government welfare and intervention. Minority women are also more inclined to be single women and therefore contribute to the gender gap. This affects voting behaviors and their views on supporting abortions, welfare, gun control, criminal cases, etc.
- ex This gives democrats an advantage as they implement their *War on Women* strategy by emphasizing that republicans don't care about women's rights, such as abortion.

## Education
The more educated people are, the more liberal they tend to be. More educated people have more information upon which they can base their decisions. Secular reasoning creates certain outcomes and these outcomes are more liberal. Colleges also teach and therefore expose more liberal values. Finally, perhaps people who seek higher education tend to be more liberal
- ? self-serving bias or circular argument?
- ex Blue-collar workers mostly supported Trump because Trump offered policies that supported the lower-educated workers with a higher chance of employment. This is almost class warfare as more educated people are richer.

## Income
High income levels tend to lean economically conservative while low income levels lean economically liberal. Both groups are socially mixed to be both liberal and conservative.
- Income has somewhat lost its benefit as a good indicator of ideology since income levels are becoming murky and there doesn't seem to be such a strong trend anymore (eg: republicans for high income levels).
- ex Higher income level people tend to have higher education, and there is a definite trend that higher education and thus more liberal teachings. This makes a split between both liberal and conservative high income levels.

## Ethnicity and Race
90% of blacks vote for the Democrat party, and are thus heavily liberal both economically and socially. This is the most loyal group of all races and ethnicity. In recent years, more blacks have emphasized the movement towards social liberalism based on secular reasoning. This is similar to mainline Protestantism, as black churches have become to move towards secularization of social values. However, few black men are beginning to look at conservatism policies.
- ex During the Trump election, democrats call him a racist so they can prevent the blacks from moving towards the republican party. Blacks are a huge population for the democrats to maintain and win.

60% of hispanics vote for the Democrat party, and are thus heavily liberal both economically and socially. More hispanics have emphasized the movement towards social liberalism (due to secularism) instead of socially conservatism, similar to blacks. Hispanics are important since they are the fasting growing group in the US.
- But hispanics are even more recently beginning to become economically and socially conservative. From 2016 to 2020, more hispanics are voting for Trump in spite of Trump being accused of being a racist.
- It's important to note that hispanics aren't like a single group of similar people. Hispanics come from Spanish speaking countries, and there are *a lot* of Spanish countries in Central and South America (eg: Cubans, who are also hispanics, are economically conservative and socially mixed, and are thus the exception among hispanics to vote republican since they really hate communism and relate liberalism with communism).

## Region
The New England region (Vermont, Connecticut area) are overwhelming liberal as it is a highly secular region in the US.
- Religious believers call the NE region the coffin-zone as nobody believes in Jesus or praying and attending Church all the time.
- There are outliers though. New Hampshire are follow the policy of [[libertarianism]], but recently begun to turn more liberal. Maine also used to be conservative but is growing more liberal. This is because people in Massachusetts (typically liberal) are buying property in those states and are called "Mass-holes". Thus, New Hampshire and Maine are [[swing state]] as there is a split between the older conservatives and younger liberals.

The Mid-Atlantic region (New York to Maryland) are very liberal, but Pennsylvania is more mixed, thus making Pennsylvania a [[swing state]]. Eastern Pennsylvania is more liberal but Western Pennsylvania is more like a Mid-Western state and is more conservative.
- States with large cities often are more liberal. (eg: Pennsylvania, the big cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are more liberal, and New York City). States with more rural areas are more conservative, probably driven by the secular and religious divide.

The Southern region (Virginia to Texas) is also known as the Bible Belt since that region is extremely religious and follow judaeo Christian values, though there is a gradual movement towards secularism. Many evangelicals live in the South. This is the typical conservative region of the US. The South also doesn't like the federal government, stemming from the [[Reconstruction Period]] following the [[Civil War]]. Virginia was a [[swing state]] but now is heavily liberal as many people living there (especially Northern Fairfax) works for the federal government and support the liberalism. There are other [[swing state|swing states]] within the Southern region, such as Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia. A lot of liberal people are moving into those states, which causes the cities to become heavily liberal but the rest of the state to become conservative.

The Midwest region (Ohio to Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri) is known as the Rust Belt as it used to have lots of heavy refineries. The Midwest is mostly a mix of ideologies, mainly due to the heavy presence of unions, who are typically liberal. Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Michigan are a [[swing state|swing states]], partly due to their agricultural background. Missouri often behaves as a Southern state and is losing its swing state potential.
- Trump won this area, even though it was normally a region that voted for democrats. Trump appealed to the populists and blue-collar workers.
- ? why do agriculture cause a state to become swing states?

The Western region (not including California, Oregon, and Washington) are a conservative region. A ton of land in the Western region is owned by the federal government. Mining and agriculture are the major industries in the Western region, and the federal government keeps on hampering on their work on where and how they can mine or grow crops. That has led them to be largely conservative and thus dislike the federal government. The Western region exhibits [[libertarianism]]. Colorado, Nevada, and Arizona are [[swing state|swing states]] due to people moving into those states from other regions (mainly California). However, New Mexico is extremely liberal compared to the other Western regions, and are composed of mostly hispanics.

The West Coast region are heavily liberal, mainly driven by the major cities within California, Oregon, and Washington.

Alaska is conservative (Western Region) while Hawaii is liberal (West Coast).
