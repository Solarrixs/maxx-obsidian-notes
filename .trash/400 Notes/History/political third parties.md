In the US, there are only [[republicans]] or [[democrats]] presidents. Third parties do exist however.
The largest third party is the [[libertarianism]].

## Types Third Parties
One issue parties: parties that focus only on one issue
- ex Prohibition Party, Right to Life Party, etc

Ideological parties: parties that focus on ideological values
- ex [[communism]], [[libertarianism]], etc

Economic protest parties: parties that focus on the economy
- ex [[populism]], working families party in NY, etc

Fractional parties: when parties break away from another party
- ex Bull Moose Party as the Republicans split vote between Teddy and Taft

## Problems for Third Parties
Due to the two party system in the US it is rare for third parties to win elected offices. An average US citizen thinks in terms of [[democrats]] and [[republicans]], and aren't accustomed to a third party. Thus, there is a lack of broad support and [[modern day political party organization#grassroot base|grassroot base]] that help to cultivate support and fundraising.

Since people know third parties can't win, people don't want to cast a vote for third parties as it would be wasted. There are also protest votes, where people are dissatisfied with the other two parties.

Voting for third parties might also lead to the voters' least favorite choice to win elections, known as a spoiler.
- ex If there was a [[democrats]], [[republicans]], and a third party similar to republicans, the republicans would have a split vote between the two people, leading to democratic victory.

The two major parties also exclude third parties. There are various state laws that make it difficult for third parties to even exist. They are also not allowed to participate in presidential debates without meeting a high 15% potential vote standard. Finally, major parties can adapt the issues of third parties, making them their own, and therefore making third parties redundant.

## Sustaining Third Parties
Third parties participate in cross-endorsement or fusion voting. In a competitive voting area, it's hard for certain parties to win, so you might as well endorse another party with similar ideologies. And if the party backed by the third parties win, they are obligated to help the policies of the third parties. This is a way for them to gain power.
- ex In New York, the conservative party cross-endorsed the republican candidates
