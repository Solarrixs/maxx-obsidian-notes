Leadership of both [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]] select key members of a bill to hammer out the differences between the 2 different bills (mostly due to the riders attached to the bill within the [[senate]]).

If differences are hammered out, it gets sent to both the House and Senate again for a vote on passage.
