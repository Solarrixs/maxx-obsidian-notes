Polls assess, measure, and gauge public opinion: how people view particular issues, events, or candidates at a moment in time.
- Just because there is a result from a poll, doesn't mean it is fixed. Public opinions are very dynamic and can change within a matter of weeks.

Polls are typically conducted through:
- phone/email/text: unreliable since it is possibly skewed for younger generation people
- mail
- exit polls: very accurate (since all people polled were voters) in gauging results of an election and can probe voters to determine the most important issues, what they felt about each candidate, etc.

Typically, closed ended questions are asked because they result in cheaper costs for analysis. Open ended questions are more accurate but take too much time and money to conduct.
