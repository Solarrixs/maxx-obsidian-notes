[[political interest groups]] may bring a case to court or help bring a case to court if it involves an issue they care about (litigation)
- ex [[SC Case - Brown v. Board of Education (1954)]]

Interest groups that focus on influencing policies through litigation pays close attention to the [[supreme court]] as it affects their ability to win a case in court.
- Depending on the time, some interest groups may find that their ability to affect court decisions change as different [[political parties]] control or make up the [[supreme court]].

An [[amicus curiae brief]] may occur.
