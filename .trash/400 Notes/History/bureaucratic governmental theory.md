Max Weber's theory of how a [[government]] obtains their power.

[[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] in a [[bureaucracy]] wields the real power in a government as bureaucrat workers are needed to maintain the entire structure of a government.
- The power of upper level bureaucratic administrators are limited by what they can do to bureaucrats.
- ex If a school administrator shits on teachers, teachers may rebel and stop working, thus messing up the school system. So school administrators requires teachers to be able to function correctly, and thus it is the teachers that have the real power.
