There is more blacks who are imprisoned than any other race. However, felons who are released and paroled are still allowed to vote due to the modern-day era of black rights. More radically, Maine and Vermont let prisoners who aren't released to vote. This is supported by [[democrats]] as they believe it would give them a political advantage by having prisoners support democrats.

The black culture heavily emphasizes voting. Black churches has also become very political, influencing the black community to vote. Thus, black turnout is extremely high these days. This was the justification for [[SC Case - Shelby County v. Holder (2013)]] decision.
