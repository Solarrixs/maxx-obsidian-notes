voter registration is the #1 reason

voter apathy (people don't care about candidates or don't think they are important), low political efficacy (people don't think their votes will matter too much), difficulty of voting like time or distance, voter complacency (when people didn't care about politics since politics aren't changing the lives of people that much).

Internal Efficacy is a person's ability to understand how the government works and the relevant institutions.

External Efficacy is a person's belief that they can actually influence the government to bring about change.

These are all addressed through [[states endorse early voting and mail in voting]], [[motor voter law of 1993]], pre clearance protection, absentee voting.

## Why Do Some People Vote?
- Important issues motivate people to vote, especially the economy.
- People motivated by a sense of civic duty.
- '' Political insiders are those people with "yard signs" and volunteer/have positions within political parties or have a job directly impacted by an elected official. This extends to family members as well.
- Political insiders in a local election (with low voter turnout rate) can swing the vote a lot.
