The [[democrats]] party in the South only allowed white people to vote in the democratic [[political primary|primary]], and thus black people were excluded from the democratic primary, and thus they cannot be nominated to run for political office.

During [[Reconstruction Period]], white people in the South hated the [[republicans]]. After the end of Reconstruction, most white people in the South therefore voted for the [[democrats]], and thus there were basically no [[republicans|republican]] competition. Thus, the candidate that won the democratic primary was going to be the winner of the general election by default because the democratic party was so dominant in the South.
- So if the primaries mainly determined election results and blacks weren't allowed to participate, they basically have no say in who has office.
- This wasn't only used against blacks. It was also used to prevent hispanics and immigrants from participating.

The [[SC Case - Smith v. Allwright (1944)]] [[supreme court]] decision ruled that white primaries were not permitted.
