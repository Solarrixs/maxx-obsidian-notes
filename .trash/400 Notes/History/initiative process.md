When citizens or electorate have the ability to bring about legislation in [[government]].

This process was pushed for by [[progressives]] as they thought it would limit the powers of [[political machines]] and political parties.

## Types of Initiatives
1. Direct Initiative: The people by petition have a piece of legislation put on the ballot for a public vote. (19 states)
	- ex In California, this led to many questionable laws, which highlights the weakness of the direct initiative.

2. Indirect Initiative: State legislature creates the legislation but they allow the people to vote on it in order to be enacted. (8 states)
	- This allows politicians to distance themselves from unpopular legislation, as they would blame the people instead. This is an [[elitist theory of a democratic republic]] of [[democracy]].

3. Direct Referendum: When a law already exists but people place it on the ballot to determine if it should continue. (24 states)
	- '' A public veto

4. Recall: The ability of people to vote to remove a local or state official from office during their term. (18 states)
	- ex A famous example is California using recall to elect Arnold Schwarzenegger.
	- This does not apply in federal elections ([[senate]], [[house of representatives]]). Only applied to state and local elections.

## Advantages of Initiatives
- Can drive turnout with a hot initiative.
	- ex By implementing an abortion initiative, [[democrats]] are hoping to garner greater [[democrats]] turnout.

## Disadvantages of Initiatives
- Money largely drives the process of initiative and ensures the passing of initiatives.
- Rash decisions are made into initiatives.
	- ex Legalization of marijuana.
