Political candidates begin to go on talk shows to promote the likability.
- [[democrats]] like to show up on these talk shows as most talk show hosts are [[liberals]].

Talk shows can broaden the access to the masses, especially when a talk show can cater to a minority population and thus allow politicians to target specific audiences as different age and racial groups listen to different talk shows.
- ex some talk shows might have a predominantly black female audience. going on that talk show can influence their opinions.
- Politicians can also go to political news shows. However, these shows will ask hard political questions. This is why many politicians will rather go into talk shows as they ask softball questions and thus circumvent traditional political media.
