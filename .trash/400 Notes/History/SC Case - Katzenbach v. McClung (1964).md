alias: SC Case - Ollies BBQ (1964)
---

Occurs in Ollie's BBQ place. He was racist and didn't let black people eat in his restaurant. After the [[civil rights act of 1964]], Ollie is forced to allow blacks eat in his restaurant.

The question was, does the [[civil rights act of 1964]] prohibit discrimination by restaurants?

Through the [[interstate commerce clause]], the [[supreme court]] decided that discrimination in restaurants posed a burden on the interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products generally. Even though the customers are domestic, and the supply comes from a local company, as long as there is a single product from out of state, then it can be regulated by the interstate commerce clause.

It also posed a restriction upon blacks moving from state to state.
