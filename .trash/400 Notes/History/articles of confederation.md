## Overview
The AoC was created immediately during the [[US revolutionary war]] in 1777, and was finally ratified and implemented at the end of the revolutionary war, during the [[battle of Yorktown]]. Because at the end, they needed a [[government]] to negotiate a peace treaty with Great Britain.

## Theme
The theme for the AoC is that States were skeptical of a central [[government]] and thus made it so the States had a lot more power than the central government. This stemmed from their recent negative experiences with the central government of Great Britain.

The States only joined together to survive against the Great Britain, so after the war, they made a loose government whose only function was to unite and protect the States under times of state. The States had a mutual cooperation and not actually friendly allies.

Thus, the only real power the AoC had was to declare war, handle international affairs, and make treaties. The whole point of the AoC was to protect the states.

## Weaknesses
- Taxation: The AoC weren't allowed to tax directly: they had the power to tax but they could not collect taxes, as it was the States that collected taxes to be turned over to the centralized government. Generally, taxes were optional, so not many people actually paid taxes.
- Armies: The AoC couldn't have a national standing army: only States had the real decision to provide soldiers to the army.
- Commerce: The AoC could not regulate commerce within states, and therefore intra-state trading would become difficult. This led many colonists being alarmed by the lack of materials available to be traded. The AoC did not establish a single currency for all the States to use.
- Legislation: It was difficult to pass new laws since each State, which has 1 vote, needed a large majority.
- Courts: Did not have a court system at the national level.

## Fixes
The initial motivations for changing the [[articles of confederation|AoC]] occurs after [[shays' rebellion of 1786]], as it reveals how a small ragtag rebellion could have heavily damaged the US government.

Thus, after Shays' Rebellion, states found a new need, urge, and interest to attend a meeting to fix the AoC, leading to the [[constitutional convention of 1787]].
