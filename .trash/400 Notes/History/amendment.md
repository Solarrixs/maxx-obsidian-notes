## 17th Amendments (1913)
Prior to this amendment, state legislatures voted for the state's senators in the [[senate]], as the fathers of the country didn't trust the general population (which in the 1800s were mostly poor and uneducated) to vote for the Senate.

This amendment enforced the direct election of senators and thus moved towards the direction of [[democracy]]. However, this also increased the power of the federal [[government]] as senators did not have to listen to state governors or state legislatures anymore. This indirectly contributed to the development of America into [[cooperative federalism]].

This was proposed during the [[Progressive Era]] to fight against [[political machines]].
