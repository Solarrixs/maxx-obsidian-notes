1. [[majoritarian theory of a democratic republic]]
2. [[elitist theory of a democratic republic]]
3. [[pluralist governmental theory]]
- How prominent and broad an issue is determines whether it would behave in a majoritarian or elitist way. If the general public is passionate, the certain law will be majoritarian based. If a law is obscure and people don't care about it as much, the law will be elitist based (leading to the [[government]] to refer to the [[pluralist governmental theory]] and make decisions based upon [[political interest groups]]).
