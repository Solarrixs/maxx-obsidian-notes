## Structure
There is a national, state, and county committees everywhere. However, some areas also have town committees.
- ex Democratic [[political national committees|national committee]]→ New York State Democratic Committee → Nassau County Democratic Committee → Town of North Hempstead Democratic Committee

## Grassroot Base
There are also grassroots level clubs and organizations. These aren't part of the official [[political parties|political party]] structure but make up the base of the party and thus have the most power since it is where the votes (people), money (fundraisers), and information spreaders (putting up yard signs) come from.
- To maintain healthy grassroots organizations, parties need to win. If a party loses really bad, grassroot organizations lose faith and support for the party (since nobody likes losers!)
- ex Roslyn Republican Club, etc
