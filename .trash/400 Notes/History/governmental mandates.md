Governmental mandates is when the federal [[government]] directs states to carry an action out.
1. Court decisions - can force a state to do something
2. Legislation - the federal government can pass a law to force a state to do something
3. Regulation - government agencies pass a pseudo-law to force a state to do something

- ex A famous example of mandates was during the desegregation of schools. [[SC Case - Brown v. Board of Education (1954)]] was a court decision that forced states to compel with desegregation. This was an example of an unfunded mandate.
- ex The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) was led by the EEOC was a significant money endeavor to implement nationwide. As every building had to adhere to the mandates set out by the legislation, this costed billions, and all states had to comply. This is also an example of an unfunded mandate.
- ex The Clean Water and Air Act by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] were pieces of legislation that forced states to comply to set standards.

## Unfunded Mandates
Unfunded mandates are when the federal government does not give states the money necessary to implement a directive that they issued. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act forced states to spend a ton of money in renovating buildings to fit the new directive.

The [[Unfunded Mandate Reform Act (1995)]] forces [[congress]] to have a cost-analysis done before they vote on any legislation with an unfunded mandate. This also applies to future regulations as result of the legislation. This was a very weak piece of regulation as it still allowed unfunded mandates to be passed as long as there was a cost-analysis done. This was exempt to civil rights legislation though.
