Original jurisdiction: the right of a court to hear a case first.
Appellate jurisdiction: the right of a court to review a case again from a lower court.
- Appeals aren't granted automatically. There must be evidence to demonstrate how misconduct occurred in a lower court.
- ex The [[supreme court]] usually operates in appellate jurisdiction, but sometimes can operate under original jurisdiction with cases regarding diplomats/ambassadors, two states, US vs. State, and a case brought by a state against an individual of another state.
