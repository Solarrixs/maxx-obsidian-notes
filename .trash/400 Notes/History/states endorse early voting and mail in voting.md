46 states allow early voting without excuses or reasons. It's good because it's convenient and allows more time for voting, but could also be bad since people can't change their votes and things can change. Once someone votes early, anyone can figure out who voted early. Early voting also allow parties to track who voted early and stop wasting manpower and money on people who voted early to be redirected to people who haven't voted yet. This is called banking the vote, and it is favored by richer people.

8 states use mail in voting for all elections. The first state to allow this was Oregon. The problem with this was that it is easier to cheat. Some states also allow for ballot harvesting, where people will go to other people's houses to help the average person to vote and cast their mail ballots. However, this can lead to voter fraud, as people who commit ballot harvesting can choose whether or not to submit someone's votes. This is supported by [[democrats]] as they have an advantage in doing ballot harvesting in urban areas, especially in poor, minority areas. Early voting also allows for mail voting.
