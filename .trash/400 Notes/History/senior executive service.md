Created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

Appointees and non-appointees may be moved with the [[bureaucracy]] more easily at high level positions in order to make the [[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] more responsive to the [[US president|president]]'s administration.

It didn't seem to work, and all high level bureaucrats are all powerful.

This was aimed to help the administration move uncooperative bureaucrats in the [[government]].
