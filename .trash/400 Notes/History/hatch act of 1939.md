FDR was concerned that after creating a larger [[bureaucracy]] through the [[New Deal]] policies, the [[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] will gain power and advantages.

Federal employees are barred from taking part in partisan policies. This makes it illegal to fire federal employees for partisan concerns except for the highest level employees
- Federal employees may not run for federal office while employed as well.

Ultimately revised in 1993 under Clinton.
- Less Restricted Employees: can hold leadership positions in parties and actively campaign including raising funds for the campaign
- Further Restricted Employees: CIA, FBI, IRS [[bureaucrat|bureaucrats]] are blocked from partisan activity.
