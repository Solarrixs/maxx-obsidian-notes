Corporation-like [[political interest groups]] can give money to campaigns through [[federal election campaign act#PACs]]. This allows [[political interest groups]] to offer basically unlimited money to campaigns through advertising. Interest groups can also gain contributions from [[federal election campaign act#super PACS]].
- ex The NRA has a political victory fund (PVF) that ask for donations.

Bundling can also occur. Political parties really like rich people (and their connections) and money as it allows them for to access bundlers. Bundlers will ask their friends to write $28,000 to a candidate and directly donate it to governmental officials. This bypasses the hard money limit by [[political action committee|PACs]]. This can be done numerous times for many different political officials.
- This seems to look like bribing. Interest groups are making campaign donations, which ensures that the government officials will follow the wishes of the interest group.
