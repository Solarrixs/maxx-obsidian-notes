A [[supreme court]] case.

Rhode Island and Pennsylvania provide part of funding for private parochial school teachers.

The question before the court was, does this violate the establishment clause?

A Lemon Test was created as a result:
1. Does the law have a secular rather than a religious purpose?
2. Does the law neither promote nor discourage religion?
3. Does the law prevent an excessive entanglement of the government and religious institutions.

All must be answered affirmatively to be constitutional.

Does, the court ruled that the Lemon case was unconstitutional.

Similar to [[SC Case - Everson v. Board of Education (1947)]].
