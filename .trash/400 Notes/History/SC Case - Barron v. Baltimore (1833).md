A [[supreme court]] case.

Barron loses a ton of money due to a public works project that Baltimore enacts. Barron sued the City of Baltimore for losses, arguing that he was deprived of his property without the due process afforded him by the [[amendment#5th amendment]].

The Supreme Court argued that the [[bill of rights]] exists to protect citizens from the national [[government]], not from the state governments.
