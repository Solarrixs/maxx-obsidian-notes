The anti-federalists were worried about how much power the federal [[government]] would have over the states under the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]]. Even if the government is currently limited, they believed that the federal government will increasingly gain more power to overpower the states.
- In hindsight, the anti-federalists were right, as the government has been increasing in power over history.

The anti-federalists began to write the anti-federalist papers against the ratification of the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]]. The most famous one is called [[brutus no. 1]]. In the end, they pushed for the Constitution to have a [[bill of rights]] once they realized they were losing to the [[federalists]].
