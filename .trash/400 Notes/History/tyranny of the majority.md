When a majority of the population supports a decision, they can suppress the views of the minority. Fundamentally, this does not align with the ideals of [[democracy]], so democratic [[government|governments]] attempt to prevent [[tyranny of the majority]] (see: [[indirect democracy]], [[pluralist governmental theory]]).
- A majority of people who supported the vaccine will support the others getting the vaccine, forcing the minority to either compel or face consequences.
