Presidential nominees occurs in the [[national party convention]].

Presidential primary and caucus are the mechanism for choosing a nominee. These work differently than a [[political primary|primary]] or [[caucus]] for other elected offices.
- Each party can have different forms of presidential primaries and utilize different numbers of delegates. [[democrats]] have 4334~ delegates while [[republicans]] have 2066~ delegates. This is due to democrats' goal of being inclusive and having all types of people to serve as delegates. A simple majority determines the nominee.

Only [[democrats]] have super delegates. There are about 800 super delegates, who are democrat-supporting elected officials or past officials that are given a delegate vote by the democratic [[political national committees|national committee]]. They can only vote on the second ballot if there isn't a clear winner, which limited the power of the democrats.
- Prior to this, democrats picked too many [[liberals]], which did not gain favor in the general election. So the super delegates aimed to prevent the nominee of very liberal candidates, but it didn't work since super delegates still led to the nominee of super liberals
