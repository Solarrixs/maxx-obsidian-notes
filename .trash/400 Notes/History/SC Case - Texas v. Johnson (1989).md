A [[supreme court]] case.

Johnson wants to burn the American flag legally as an expression of freedom of speech?

The court decides that the [[government]] may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. (So yes, you can burn an American flag!)
