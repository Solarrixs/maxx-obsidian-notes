[[senate|senators]] can hold the floor during a [[senate]] debate to prevent any vote or action on a bill since there is no limit on debates.
- This can be stopped with a [[cloture vote]].

Recently, double tracking was created: if a senator says they are going to filibuster, that is enough to establish no action on a bill.
- ? what the hell

In 2013, a nuclear option was added: [[democrats]] changed the rules so there can be no filibusters done on appointments except for [[supreme court]] nominees. No filibusters on [[supreme court]] nominees was enforced by [[republicans]] in 2017.
