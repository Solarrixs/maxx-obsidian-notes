[[government]] should help provide for **equality of results** under the idea of social justice. Generally supports [[democrats]]
- ex their justification of giving lenient punishments to criminals is that they were raised poor or that their parents are criminals, so it might be hard for them to change, so then they deserve a second chance
- ex this plays a factor in education as well - asians are discriminated in prestigious colleges while blacks and hispanics are elevated into prestigious colleges

government should serve to protect individual rights through legal protections or by not interfering with them. Individual rights are open to interpretation. These are justified by secular reasoning.
- ex gay rights and marriage, abortions, etc

government is a positive force and should actively regulate the economy or businesses to provide for economic justice or equality of results
