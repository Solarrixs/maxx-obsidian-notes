A [[supreme court]] case.

Schenck was arrested for handling out infographics about resisting world war 1 drafts. Since the prosecution was by the US, the [[amendment#1st amendment]] applies here.

However, the [[supreme court]] ruled that Schenck's freedom of speech rights were not denied, because there are limitations on your freedom of speech rights (if it promotes clear and present danger).
