Same situation as [[SC Case - Baker v Carr (1962)]].

This case (not a [[supreme court]] case) focused on the blacks moving to cities. Sims is black person who argued that his county had way too few legislatures for their population size.

The court ruled that "one man one vote", meaning that congressional districts should be the same based on population size.
