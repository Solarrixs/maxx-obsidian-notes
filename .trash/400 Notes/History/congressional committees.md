Both the [[house of representatives]] and [[senate]] house many committees, which are small groups of congressmen that focuses on specific tasks. This allows individuals to specialize in a certain area and make better decisions overall.

Authorizing Committees are responsible for creating laws regarding some area of expertise. They create guidelines as to how much money can be spent on the area they are responsible for through authorization bills.
- '' They authorize the government to do things
- Every time a new bill or legislation is passed, it will cost money to enforce it. That is why the authorizing committees are needed to create guidelines for spending.
- ex Homeland Security, Agriculture, Transportation

Administrative Committees determine the way the House and Senate will function.
- ex [[congress rules committees]], Ethics Committees, Committee on Committees, etc

[[house and senate appropriations committees]] determine how much money will actually be spent on various authorizations.

Revenue and Budget Committees determine how the [[government]] will raise the money they need to fund operations, including considering funding future expenditures.
- ex [[House and Senate budget committees]] and the [[house ways and means committee]] are notable examples.

Committees generally have a responsibility to provide oversight: the responsibility of committees to keep track of if the [[government]] is functioning properly regarding the laws they have created or money they have spent on programs.
- Very difficult task since there are just too many laws and programs. It is only effective after something happened.
- Hearings are a way oversight is conducted. Hearings have subpoena powers, which allows them to demand a person's appearance (or documents) before the committee to testify.

The [[senate]]'s Committee on Committees and the [[house of representatives]]' Steering and Policy Committee determine committee assignments. People can be punished for their political actions through committee reassignments.
- Politicians are typically assigned to their area of expertise before they became a politician.
- Also divided by seniority and strategy - depends on their standing as a politician and the strategies of the party's purposes. Seniority used to be the most important, but nowadays it is more dependent on party strategy.

The Chairman of committees were historically awarded to the person who has served on the committee the longest (seniority) but these days, merit is a huge factor in determining chairperson.
- Chairman must be part of the majority party. Likewise, majority of members on each committee are of the majority party.

All committees are further broken into subcommittees with more specific tasks than the main committee.
