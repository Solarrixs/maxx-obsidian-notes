A compromise that splits the bicameral legislature into a part of equal state representation and a part of population-based state presentation.
- The upper chamber, the [[senate]], allows 2 representatives per state. Originally selected by state legislatures ([[elitist theory of a democratic republic]]) but changed by the 17th Amendment so that the people vote for their Senators ([[direct democracy]]).
- The lower chamber, the [[house of representatives]], allows various representatives per state based on population.

This becomes implemented into the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] in the [[constitutional convention of 1787]].
- '' This compromise acknowledges that the United States are merely a group of united, yet individual states.
- '' This compromise also leads to tensions between states in the future.
- The Virginia Plan wins at a 5-4 vote, where 3 states did not participate in their votes.

This is the one part of the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] that cannot be changed.
