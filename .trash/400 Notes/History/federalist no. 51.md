## The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments
Government is needed to prevent anarchy (which is no rule). After the [[constitutional convention of 1787]], [[James Madison]] is defending the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] as protecting liberty even though it is a stronger form of [[government]].

This paper talks about the separate and distinct powers of the US [[government]].
- '' It is evident that each department should have a will of its own... and should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.
- In essence, members within each department should be independent from other departments. They shouldn't pick each other's department members so they can't be dependent.
- However, one exception is the judicial branch, where only the executive branch can pick them instead of the commoners. To prevent dependency, judicial appointees are appointed for life.

However, to achieve the above, it requires giving the government enough power to not only govern the normal civilians but also the power to control itself.
- '' In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.

As the legislation branch is the most powerful branch, it should be further subdivided into multiple departments - like the [[house of representatives]] and the [[senate]].

There are two major considerations particularly applicable to the [[federalism|federal system of government]] in the US.
1. In a single republic, all power is surrendered by the people to a single government, which is divided into distinct and separate departments. In a compound republic, power is surrendered to two distinct governments, and the portion allotted to each subdivided government is allotted among distinct and separate departments as as double security.
2. Republic needs to guard society against the oppression of its own rulers but to also guard society against the injustice of society itself (such as different interests among different classes of citizens, or protecting against the [[tyranny of the majority]]).
	1. & Thus, having a large republic is beneficial. More people is more factions, which will prevent against one unified and strong faction. No one group will dominate all factions.
