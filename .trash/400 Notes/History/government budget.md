The [[US president|President]] is supposed to deliver a budget to [[congress]] for consideration every February.
- ex In 2019, the budget was approximately 4 trillion.

A greater budget leads to greater wasteful spending since it is hard to keep track of all the money.

A fiscal year for the US runs from Oct 1 to September 30.
- However, fiscal years for different institutions may be different.
