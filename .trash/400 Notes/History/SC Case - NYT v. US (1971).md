A [[supreme court]] 7-0 decision that supported NYT and Washington Post. There will be no prior restraint on the print media, and thus the freedom of the press is greatly expanded even if it involves national security. The [[amendment#1st amendment]] was upheld. However, if information was obtained illegally, proper punishment will still ensue.

Within the 1960s under President Lyndon B. Johnson, there were many protests to the Vietnam War.

The Defense Compartment decides to have a writeup of the Vietnam War - a study on how and why the US got into the Vietnam War.

A guy who is writing the study decides to steal a part of it and leaks it to the Washington Post and New York Times. There are things within the study that suggested that the US [[government]] were hiding data and facts from the American public.

Public opinion for the Vietnam War within the US turns extremely hostile in 1971, even though it was Nixon's presidency instead of Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. Therefore, Nixon tries to get the NYT and Washington Post to stop reporting on the news by saying that it was detrimental to national security, but the news corporation rejects and sues.
