This [[political primary|primary]] allow all candidates prior to a general election appear on the same ballot. The top two winners face off in the general election.

This was created to allow people to vote to different parties, but prevented people who strongly support 1 party to sabotage the primaries of another.
- This makes it possible for 2 people in the same party to go against each other in a general election. This strongly discourages raiding.
- ex Alaska and Louisiana has a variation of the non-partisan blanket primary
- ex California and Washington have a true non-partisan blanket primary
