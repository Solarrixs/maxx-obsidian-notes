Created by [[James Madison]] during the [[constitutional convention of 1787]].

The Virginia Plan proposes:
- ex Bicameral legislature (two chambers where wealth or population would dictate representation in both chambers. This was because [[James Madison]] was part of Virginia, which was the most populated and wealthiest state)
- ex Three branches of government (separation of powers)
- ex Checks and balances (limits the consolidation of power)
- ex Ability for the [[government]] to overrule state laws

The [[virginia plan]] beats out the [[new jersey plan]] in a vote, but there were still many disagreements about the Virginia Plan, such as the [[great compromise]], [[3-5 compromise]], and general issues regarding [[slavery]].
