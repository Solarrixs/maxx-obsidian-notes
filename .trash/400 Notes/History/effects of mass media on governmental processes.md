## How Can the Media Affect Public Opinion?
1. Media can influence/shape public opinion on issues that people **do not** have a strong opinion on or have no opinion on.
	- ex The media has effectively made Americans support Ukraine even though they have no clue what Ukraine is.
2. Gatekeeping: The media can choose what can be reported and shown to the people.
3. Agenda Setting: The issues that are focused heavily on by the media often must be addressed by the [[government]] as the general public become more aware of a problem.
4. Issue Framing: The way information is presented to convey a point of view, whether that be favorable or unfavorable.
	- ex Insurrection - Jan 6 Riots && Protest - George Floyd
	- Although George Floyd protests were more destructive and longer lasting, the milder term protest was used over insurrection. These are examples of loaded language (powerful words that convey a point of view).

## How Do People and Their Choice of Media Affect Their Own Opinions?
1. Selective Exposure: only look for news that reaffirm personal beliefs. This leads to [[confirmation bias]].
	1. ex [[conservatives]] watch Fox && [[liberals]] watch CNN.
2. Selective Perception: filtering out stuff to confirm what you already believe.
