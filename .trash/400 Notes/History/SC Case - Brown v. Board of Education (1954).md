Nine year old Linda Brown and other black children in Kansas were being segregated by public schools. The NAACP was responsible for bringing this case into court.

[[supreme court]] decision ruled that separating children in public schools on the basis of race was unconstitutional.

Signaled the end of legalized racial segregation in the schools of the United States, overruling the "separate but equal" principle set forth in the [[SC Case - Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)]] case.

Eventually leads to the [[SC Case - Board of Education II (1955)]]
