This piece of legislation was highly successful. Once blacks had federal protection, they were allowed to vote in large numbers.

- Made[[ literacy tests]] illegal.
- It allowed federal workers to go into states where less than 50% of the black population voted and register black voters. This attempted to stop the intimidation forced upon blacks.
- It made a federal crime to interfere with a person voting. The FBI were allowed to investigate and prosecute those who interfered with black votes.
- States that had a history of discriminatory voting behavior needed approval of the federal [[government]] to change voting processes. This was known as pre-clearance. In the [[SC Case - Shelby County v. Holder (2013)]] [[supreme court]] decision, this was struck down. ^3e68c1
