1. On the Record: Whatever a journalist hears can be written and sourced.
2. On Background: Vague indication of the source. The problem is that the source is hard to identify and undermines the validity. However, the public doesn't question the validity of these sources.
3. Deep Background: Anonymous source. This happens a lot in media and should be read with caution.
4. Off the Record: Can't use the info for a story. This is kept in trust by journalists and thus they will never leak the information.
5. Leaks: When private information gets leaked to journalists and become public information.
	- Keep in mind how this leak would benefit certain groups and harm other groups. Leaked information should be taken into consideration for validity.
6. Trial Balloons (specific type of leak): a purposeful leak to see what the public thinks about it, and then denied or accepted based on public opinion
7. The Big Lie: taking something that is not true and repeat it relentlessly until the average person come to believe that it is true.
	- As the media is mostly [[liberals|liberal]], [[democrats]] have an advantage in utilizing the Big Lie.
