funding of elections (see: [[matching funds]]) are regulated by the [[federal election campaign act]].

## Public Funding of Presidential General Election
1. The nominee of each party will receive $85,000,000 to run their general election campaign after their [[national party convention]].
2. No other money may be used for official candidate campaign other than $50,000 of their personal money.
3. [[political third parties|third party]] candidates are excluded from public funding unless they can win 5% of the popular election vote in the last presidential election. If they qualify, they are given a lesser amount based upon past support.
