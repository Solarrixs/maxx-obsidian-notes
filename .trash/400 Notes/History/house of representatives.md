## Positions within the House

### Speaker of the House
usually a member of the majority party, elected by other house reps (need 219 majority votes). This is a constitutional position defined in [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]].

3rd highest ranked official. If the president and vice-president dies, the speaker of the house becomes the president. This is because the speaker of the house is generally elected by the people of the US.

The speaker of the house sets agendas within the House. If the president and speaker are of the same party, then they will agree with each other and sets mutually favorable agendas. However, if the president and speaker are of different parties, then the speaker will set agendas opposing the president's policies.

### Majority Leader
Assists the speaker of the house, such as setting the agenda of the House.
- & oftentimes, the majority leader wants to be the speaker of the house, so there might be tension and disagreements between the speaker and majority leader.

each party has a majority leader chosen by the party's independent [[caucus]].

### Majority Whip
Keep track of party support for particular legislative initiatives that a party is pushing for. They can also convince members to support the agenda. The whip also have some say in determining agendas and control over the calendar.
- Can be seen as an intermediary step between the upper House leadership and normal House members.
- ex Soft Tactic: "how can we change this bill to convince you to support this bill? is there other piece of legislation that you support that we can work together on?"
- ex Hard Tactic: "if you don't work with us, you won't ever get a leadership position within the House. we'll pit someone against you in a [[political primary|primary]] so you will lose and drop out of the House."

each party has a majority whip chosen by the party's independent [[caucus]].

### Minority Leadership
There are also minority leadership positions chosen by the minority party.
- ex House Minority Leader & Minority Whip & Assistant Democratic Leader (only [[democrats]] have this. established in 2010)
- ex Nancy Pelosi loses the House Majority Leader but refuses to resign, so another position had to be created. Nancy Pelosi has a super strong [[political action committee#leadership PACs|leadership PAC]].

Being a minority in the House is completely shit as they will get outvoted from everything and not accomplish anything.
- Therefore, some House members within the minority party might want to assist the majority party so they can accomplish something. This makes the minority whip's jobs much harder.
