An issue with [[congressional districts]]. Can be caused by [[gerrymandering]].

In 1982 [[congress]] amended the [[voting rights act of 1965]] to allow for congressional districts comprised of mostly blacks or hispanics. The aim is to increase the amount of minority members in [[congress]]. This leads to [[gerrymandering]] of the district to ensure that minorities are the majority of a congressional district.
- This is similar to affirmative action in colleges as it allowed black or hispanic people to have an easier time to enter into [[congress]].

Advocates to substantive representation are opposed to the majority-minority districts as they argue that race is irrelevant in how legislatures act.

Advocates of descriptive representation support the majority-minority districts because they argue that black people can only get effective representative from people of the same color.

[[democrats]] supported this because they believed that having a majority-minority district through [[gerrymandering]] practices of cracking and packing would allow them to easily win the black and hispanic votes, but they did not take into account that surrounding districts will become more [[republicans|republican]] as there are less blacks and hispanics. This leads to the [[SC Case - Shaw v. Reno (1993)]]
