A [[supreme court]] case.

Can New York state have a voluntary nondenominational prayer at the start of the school day? Nobody needs to participate, and it does not mention a specific type of God or religious deity. Ultimately, does this violate the Establishment Clause of the [[amendment#1st amendment]]?

In a 6-1 decision, this violates the Establishment Clause.
