An issue regarding [[slavery]]. A compromise during the formation of the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] based on the problem of state representation in the [[house of representatives]] and taxation.

Each slave will count as 3/5 of a person to count in state populations, thus affecting representation in the [[house of representatives]] and taxation.
