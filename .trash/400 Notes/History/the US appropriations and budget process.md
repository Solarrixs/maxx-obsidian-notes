The job of the President to deliver a budget to [[congress]] for consideration each year in February.

Before [[SARS-CoV-2|COVID19]], it was a $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year of US from October 1st to September 30th.

The executive branch has the [[office of management and budget]].
The legislative branch has the [[congressional budget office]].

There are 12 appropriation bills that fund the [[government]]. These bills must each be passed to fund different areas of the government. Once the President signs the independent 12 bills, then the US budget is passed.
- This begins in February and should all be done by October 1st to start the fiscal year.

Almost 63% of the US budget is already pre-determined and falls outside of the appropriations process. Many of them include [[government entitlements]].
- The budget can be divided by mandatory spending (the spending must be passed) and discretionary spending (the spending could increase or decrease)

## Non-regular order
If the process is not completed by October 1st, then a [[stop gap spending bill]] is passed.
An [[omnibus bill]] can also be passed.
