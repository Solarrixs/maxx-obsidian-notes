The first election result was broadcasted via radio in 1928. News began to be broadcasted on the radio and dramatically speeds up the spread of news. Additionally, people are not required to be literate to listen to the news. Thus, there is a new class of customers that are able to consume media now.

FDR was able to use the radio very effectively through fireside chats. This allowed him to better communicate with the public and sway people's opinions through "slick delivery". This essentially allowed FDR to have a huge [[bully pulpit]] influence, which ultimately allowed him to enact the [[New Deal]]. The public was also very trusting of mass media, while these days everyone believes that media is lying or fake.
