## Positions within the Senate

### President of the Senate
The vice president is the president of the Senate. The only job of the president of the Senate is to break ties, otherwise it has no power.
- This is a constitutional position.

### President Pro-tempore
A ceremonial position without actual power. Any Senator can fill this position, which can replace the president of the Senate if the vice president isn't there.

Historically, the president pro-tempore is given to the oldest and longest serving Senator.

### Senate Majority Leader
An actually important leadership position that schedules the business of the Senate, controls the calendar, and helps formulate agenda.

### Majority Whip
In contrast to the [[house of representatives]], only soft tactics are used. Being a whip in the Senate is all about making deals and favors with other Senators.

Senators in general are expected to be very respectful of each other.

### Minority Leadership
minority leader: attempts to work with the majority leader whenever possible. Unlike the House, the Senate needs cooperation between the majority and minority leadership.
