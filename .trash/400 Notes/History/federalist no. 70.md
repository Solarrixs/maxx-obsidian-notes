## The Executive Department Further Considered
This was written by [[Alexander Hamilton]] to argue for a single, robust executive form of [[government]] provided for within the [[proposal and ratification of the US constitution]] after the [[constitutional convention of 1787]].

A strong executive [[government]] is necessary.
- '' A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.

So if a strong executive is necessary, what should be done to achieve it? And how can you control the strength of the executive?
- '' Unity, duration, adequate provision for its support, and competent powers. A due dependence on the people and a due responsibility is also necessary.

The strong executive should be a singular person such that the person can be held accountable and fight against the [[tyranny of the majority]].
- Many references were made to the Roman Empire and Republic. In the Council of Rome, everyone just blamed each other, and nobody ever could get anything done.
- A strong and singular executive is supposed to fight against the legislative power and the [[tyranny of the majority]]. That person should hold duration in office to be accountable to the people.
