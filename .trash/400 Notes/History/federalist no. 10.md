Written by [[James Madison]] as part of the [[federalist papers]].

Factions are going to rise up and are naturally created as part of the human nature.

It is better to control factions than to prevent the causes of factions. This can be done by creating a large republic with so many factions that it would be hard for just one faction to rise up and oppress others.
