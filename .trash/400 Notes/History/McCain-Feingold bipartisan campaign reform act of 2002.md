Attempts to prevent the soft money loophole found in [[political action committee|PACs]].
1. Bans soft money contributions to national parties
2. Increased hard money limits from $1000 to $2800
3. PAC contribution limits unchanged: $5000
4. Restricts corporations, labor unions, and non-profits from using their money to run electioneering ads that can influence an election within 30 days of a [[political primary|primary]] or 60 days of a general election

[[political action committee|PACs]] can continue to run these ads though because they can use hard money to run election ads.
