The best way to market is for your own user base to market it for you. You don't have to do any work.

1. Gamification - leaderboards incentivizes daily users to return. Think Habitica or Duolingo.
2. Personal Novelty & Share-ability - new and exciting tech that can easily be viewed by others without using that specific SaaS will generate discussions. Spotify for example allows other people to listen along with you, and share your yearly stats.
3. Referral - users will refer others, driving unique users. Dropbox pioneered this sort of system.
4. Incentives - importing from different apps prevent the [[sunk cost fallacy]]. Personalized content also helps a lot. A lot of habit tracking apps import CSVs to import your data from other apps.
5. User connections - allow users to interact with the company by sharing their results to be put on the company page. Gives a sense of brand loyalty and novelty.
