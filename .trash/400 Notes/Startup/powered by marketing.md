try a small, subtle, hyperlinked "powered by" sign on the bottom.
- free advertisement or users pay you more to remove it
- make it opt-out service or roll out in batches (such as new customers early, then 10% of existing customers, etc) to prevent backlash

Alternatively, do something so the company your product powers by is feeling proud.
- Announce they’re a “golden customer”, give them some trophy, bonus, which will contribute to them mentioning you on their Twitter/Facebook/blog.
- Change the wording to "Proudly using..." or add a reputable/cute image
