There are 7 main steps in a new product development process.
1. Idea Generation
2. Market Research
3. Planning
4. Prototyping
5. Sourcing
6. Costing
7. Commercialization

## Idea Generation
Use the SCAMPER model: substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate, rearrange existing products.

## Market Research
You need to validate your product first, to ensure that people will pay for the product you create.
1. Share your idea with a target market on online forums, or send out an online survey for feedback
2. Start a crowdfunding campaign
3. Research market demand with Google Trends
4. Run a feasibility study
5. Conduct competitive analysis: see [[ChatGPT product management prompts]].

## Product Planning
Get started with a hand-drawn sketch of what your product will look like. Write up it's main features, target audience, retail price, materials, etc.

## Prototyping
Experiment with many different versions of your product, before slowly eliminating bad options and making improvements to a final one. A minimum viable product is the goal for now.

Often, entrepreneurs will work with a third party to prototype their product through local services.

If you have a CAD model, the 3D design need to have molds made for each part before it can be turned into a physical model. This should be done through 3D printing, as it is a low cost and quick turnaround time. [Hubs](https://www.hubs.com/) is a good example.

After having a minimum viable product (MVP), give it to early customers to use. This helps validate a product concept, and helps product managers get user feedback to iterate some improvements.

## Sourcing
After a finished prototype, you need to gather materials and secure partners needed for production. This is known as building the supply chain. Project management is crucial here.

This phase mainly involves finding manufacturers or suppliers, but also factoring storage, shipping, and warehousing costs.

Most likely, you will source from overseas in China. Go on Alibaba and try to find a manufacturer that creates goods similar to your idea. Make sure the manufacturers is a gold supplier, verified, and have trade assurance on their Alibaba page.

You can also go on online directories for manufacturers.

Narrow a list of 5 or so manufacturers, then you want quotes. Make sure to answer these questions:
1. Can they accommodate custom orders? Do they have the skills? The resources? Do they have automation features?
2. What are their leads times? How long will it take to produce and ship items?
3. What are shipping costs? Shipping makes up a massive portion of small business expenses.
4. What are their minimum order quantities (MOQs)? Don’t lead with this question. It’ll make you look like a beginner and deter manufacturers from working with you. However, you’ll want to know the minimum amount of items you have to order before they start producing your product. This is highly negotiable.
5. What is the cost per unit? While you’re negotiating MOQs, you’ll also want to negotiate cost per unit. The larger the order, the lower your cost per unit can be.
6. Are there setup fees involved?
7. What’s their defect policy? Find out who eats the cost for incorrect or defective items. Who pays for the shipping and duties?
8. For payment terms, ask for 50% upfront, 50% after shipment is received.

When emailing manufacturers, make sure to have a concise email and stick with minimal questions.

When you receive a sample, keep the sample, and date and sign the sample. These are control samples to assure quality and consistent consumer products.

## Costing
You need to create a price for your product. You need to add up your cost of good sold (COGS) so you can determine retail price and gross margin. This allows you to come up with a pricing strategy.

## Commercialization
Send product launch emails, work with influencers on an affiliate marketing campaign, enable Instagram shopping, run chat marketing campaigns, and get reviewers.
