For B2B, develop ongoing service or software
For B2C, develop consumable products, things people buy multiple times with high lifetime value, or a subscription

People buy services mainly for these things:
1. saves them time - reduce friction or replaces time consuming task
2. makes/saves money
3. easy adoption in a workflow - easy to learn and use
4. adds transparency and insights
5. For B2C: joy or enhances life
