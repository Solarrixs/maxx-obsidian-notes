1. Why do you want to do this startup? What are your personal goals here, both financial and non-financial?
2. What will our roles and titles be? How will we divide responsibilities? Who will be CEO?
3. How will we split up equity?
4. Where will the company be based? Where will we each live? Will we work together in-person or remotely?
5. What idea will we work on? If that idea doesn't work out, are you willing to change the idea? Are you only interested in working on ideas in certain areas?
6. What needs to happen for each of us to go full-time (quit other jobs or school commitments)?
7. What is your personal financial situation? Are you willing to work for free and live on your savings? For how long? If you'll need a salary to work on this full-time (either now or at some point), how much do you need to feel comfortable? Will either of us put money into the company?
8. What will our typical working schedule be (what days we work, what hours / day, etc)? How long do we want to keep that up? Are there any things outside of work that are important to you to make time for?
9. If we are successful enough to get to build a team of employees, are there things that are important to you about how we do that? Such as building an in-person vs remote company, having certain cultural values, having a particular approach to hiring or managing people?
10. What will we do if we're having trouble agreeing on an important decision? What will happen if we decide we don't want to work together anymore?
