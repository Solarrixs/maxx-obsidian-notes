Challenges should be time-bound, fun, social, and inherently valuable

1. Choosing a challenge: something you know about, relevant to business, interesting to audience
2. Identify end results and allow for quick wins
3. Have a clear purpose and direction to do the challenge - who, target number, when, how
4. Understand what's troubling the audience, their limiting beliefs, what they know and don't, whats holding them back
5. Include bonuses - checklist ebooks practice problem interviews social media shout out contests awards discounts
6. Determine if it's evergreen challenge
