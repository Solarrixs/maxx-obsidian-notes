1. Identify your ideal customer profile (ICP)
2. Reach out to 100 ICP’s and try to convince 20-30 to do a discovery interview. The purpose of this interview is to validate the problem and understand the problem space. This also includes the priority of the problem. People pay for problems that are high priority to solve.
3. After validating the problem and priority. Follow up with the ICP who validated it was a problem and high priority. In your follow up meeting you present and validate your proposed solution to fix it. Mock ups are just fine here. Validate that they would get behind this solution.
4. Now you pick the 3 ICP’s that need the solution the most and are able to use it asap (and accept a half baked product). They are the early adopters that will help shape your product the next few months. Even if you haven't built it yet.

"You can try cold call, email, walking into their offices, FB groups, subreddits, etc. If it's a big enough problem that isn't being solved by another platform, then people will want to speak with you. I did a dozen or so interviews with potential customers before building anything for my app."

I released it in Product Hunt, Reddit, Indie Hackers, etc

I also create a Roadmap with release dates, features, and more. Just to show the user how the product will be at the beginning.
