## The 4 Most Common Mistakes
1. Solution in search of a problem - you will find a superficial problem that people don't care. You need people to care about the problem so they will buy your solution. Instead, love a concrete & trackable problem.
2. Getting stuck on tarpit ideas - formed by widespread problem that lots of potential founders encounter and seems like it could be easily solvable. But it is actually extremely difficult to solve.
3. Ensure that your solution isn't already built or implemented. A quick Google search does the trick.
4. Don't wait for the perfect startup idea but don't pick the first best idea. Most startup ideas need to be interesting that can morph into good ideas.

## 10 Key Questions to Ask
1. Do you have founder market fit? Are you the right person or team to be working on this? Pick a good startup idea for YOUR team.
2. Is it in a good market? Typically big markets or small but rapidly growing markets.
3. How acute is the problem? Ensure that a problem is actually faced by many people.
4. What is the competition? Most good startups face many competition, as it provide ideas to work around, but you just need 1 good unique idea.
5. Do you want this? Do you know people who want your solution?
6. Did this solution only become possible? Change creates opportunities.
7. Are there good proxies for this business? It is something that is similar to your startup but not a direct competitor. A proxy will show that your startup idea has a chance to work.
8. Is this an idea you want to work on for years? Often, an idea grows on founders when they begin to work, but if they don't, it is bad.
9. Is it scalable? Software is infinitely scalable but anything that requires human labor is hard to scale.
10. Is this a good idea space? A good idea space has lots of founder market fit and is "hot" or "trendy" right now.

## 3 Things that Make Your Startup Idea Good
1. If there is existing competition.
2. If it is boring. (How fun a project idea seems has no correlation with how fun it is to work with it 12 months later!)
3. If it is hard to get started.

Tips to generate good startup ideas:
- Become an expert on something valuable
- Work at a startup
- Build things you find interesting

When working with team:
- Have everyone list all their expertise, experiences, and internships
- What problems do each individual people face in your specific position/field?
