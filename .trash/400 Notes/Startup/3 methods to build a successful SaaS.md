1. Build a social media presence. Don't monetize or sell affiliate links. Just post everyday, consistently, and provide value. Only later should you sell affiliate links or ebooks or whatever.
2. Find early adopters. Message people on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc. DM them personally and garner interest. If they have enough interest, put them in your Discord Server where you share updates about your product and interact with users. All decisions you make, you can have them vote on it - this builds community.
	1. Also try to find other entrepreneurs to include in your group to expand your audience reach.
3. Build in public. Share content and updates about your journey on social media. It's a social media marketing, which drives leads. Just include the ups and downs of starting your own business. People like to see other people who are similar to them, but motivating and realistic.
