3 tools for an effective inbound email marketing strategy:
1. segmentation - send the right message to the right person at the right time. combines buyer personas and buyer journey. you need to know who the person is and where they are along a buyer's journey to send an email at the right time.
	1. buyer persona can be generated based on real data and speculation about demographics, behavior patterns, and goals.
	2. buyer journey is the process someone goes through leading up to a purchase. made up of awareness, consideration, and decision stage. you can track where everyone is along the journey by their actions, recorded in data both explicitly filled (forms) or implicitly gathered (behavior on website).
	3. you need a contact management system - a software that stores and sources a contact's info, contact history, location, product purchased, etc. like a CRM in HubSpot.
	4. divide contacts by buyer persona and journey so you can tailor email messages to smaller groups that are more relevant and engaging.
2. personalization - create trust by being highly personalized email. more than just adding their name on an email.
3. data-driven analysis - track meaningful metrics, learn what metrics indicate about success, and optimize those metrics.

monitor the health of your emailing database:
1. A list that tracks contacts who have unsubscribed
2. A list that tracks contacts who have hard bounced
3. A list that tracks all ineligible contacts
4. A list of contacts that haven't opened an email in 1 month

best practices for sending the right email:
1. set expectations with an initial "welcoming, thanking, what do we do here, how many times a week you will get our email, asking to share newsletter with friends, and thanking again" email after a signup
2. send catchy subject lines and content. think about Ship30For30 tips, and try to be more more casual. create preview text optimized for mobile devices.
3. use the AIDA framework: attention, interest, desire, and action.
	1.  get attention, then continue to build interest until they desire something enough to take action.
	2. you always want to add value, not ask for value. provide enough value and people will take action naturally.

how to optimize your email to drive conversions?
- email has high ROI. so you want to try and maximize that ROI.
- starts with opening email: optimize subject line and preview text.
	- subject line: 41-50 characters will appear on a mobile device. talk like a human and be helpful. personalize it, be creative, keep it short.
	- have email addresses come from an actual email, instead of a company email.
	- preview text: pulled from body of email, displayed underneath subject line. tease out the content of the email based on the subject line and show the value inside the email.
- email body should be a conversation - why you do it, not what you do.
	- use bullet points, bold, short paragraphs
	- adjust tone depending on buyer
	- people lose trust over small things, like misspelled words
- CTA is the most important: stick to one CTA from an email. the entire email should be focused on the CTA.

email design:
- clean and straight forward
- use email templates to create a consistent experience - including logo, colors, and language tone.
- CTA should have a lot of white space around it. large. verbs to action.
- need to have a footer to be compliant for CAN-SPAM. including physical address, unsubscribe links. add extra contact sites like Twitter or LinkedIn.
- you don't have to add all info to an email. link more info to a blog post. avoid high density walls of text.
- a plain text email can be formatted so it feels and seems like a 1-on-1 engagement. sometimes that can be useful.
- ensure that emails has a place for user engagement, such as "how did this email do?" or "share your thoughts about this topic!"

email deliverability:
- inbox - open - click - CTA - trust
- you need to get into the inbox and not into the spam of an email
- play the long game: always ensure there is verified consent and source to send email to people
- be clear the frequency of your email sending, your email messages, and your goal
- determine positive engagement signs and negative engagement signs (people who churned, unsubscribed, etc). figure out origin of contacts that showed a negative engagement.

analyzing email metrics:
1. individual
	1. send metric (how many emails actually got delivered to an inbox). this can help you clean out your database.
	2. open rate.
	3. clickthrough rate on CTA.
	4. engagement rate.
2. overall channel metrics
	1. opened and read emails a month
	2. are emails converting contacts into customers through CTA?
3. ROI
	1. subtract money invested in email campaign from money made in additional sales. divide that by total money invested in campaign and multiply by 100. that is your ROI.

develop relationships using lead nurturing
- for example, if someone downloads a PDF on how to generate an email subject line, you can send a follow up email that describes that, and also provides more resources. in a way it is like a conversation.
- automate tasks to auto email when a lead is generated. faster email sends after a lead is processed increases click through rate.
