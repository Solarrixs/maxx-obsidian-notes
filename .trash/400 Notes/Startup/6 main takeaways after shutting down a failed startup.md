1.  Passion for an idea is important, but it's not enough to sustain a business. Without a solid revenue model, it's difficult to continue investing time and resources into a project.
2.  Building a two-sided marketplace is challenging, especially for a first-time founder. Overcoming the "cold start" problem and getting traction on both sides can be difficult, particularly in a competitive space.
3.  Lack of expertise in the industry can be a major challenge. As a founder, it's important to understand the needs and pain points of all stakeholders (in this case, both job seekers and recruiters) in order to build a product that meets their needs.
4.  Solo founders have to juggle multiple responsibilities, which can lead to burnout. It's important to prioritize and focus on the most impactful tasks, rather than trying to do everything at once.
5.  Failure is a part of the entrepreneurial journey, and it's important to learn from it. Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, focus on the lessons learned and use them in future projects.
6.  It's possible to find relief and excitement after shutting down a failed business, as it opens up opportunities to try new things and take on new challenges.
