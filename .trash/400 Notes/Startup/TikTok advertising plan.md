1-Start with a new account that does have any followers or any followings
    - also do not watch videos with this account cause you may  the algorithm

2- Do your research
    - Go on TikTok, search keywords related to your niche or project and change the filter to the recent and the most viewed videos
    - look for the accounts that have few follower but viral videos ( save these videos cause you will be copying them scene by scene)
    - Look at their comments and see who are their targeting, who is their audience cause they might become your audience too
    - Look at their comment and look for the questions that people are asking, these questions can be the topics of your contents

3- Identify your audience
    - it does not need to bee too specific as long as you know how old is your audience and what is the level of their knowledge about your topic,  for example: are their newbies or pros? Are you targeting students or Moms and pops? are you targeting GenZ and millennials or boomer? 

4- You should be ready to start creating now
    - there is no perfect short video
    - do not redo a task!  don’t record one video twice
    - this is an experiment so you should be making mistakes and learn from them, the thing is you don’t know what is a mistake yet! you don’t know what is the perfect video, you will learn these along the way. so do not waste your time creating the perfect video

5- you need a script but it does need to be so detailed scene by scene
    - Hooks: you may have heard of these your first 3-5 seconds of the video are so important that’s when your audience will make the decision to watch your content or not
    - Hooks is not just the first line of your script. the way you are holding the camera, how you are talking , the lighting, your clothes, the background all of these can become a reason to watch your video (you will learn about the hook by researching I will also add some example at the end)
    - but hook , should not become a reason to overthink the video, you have time to experiment different things if you manage to create the videos faster 
6- the Content of your video should directly share a value to your audience
    - the value can be education, entertainment or both edutainment
    - You Knowledge, your experiences, your story, is a great source of content that’s why you are here for!
    - It’s always helpful to first address the problem so people who are having the same problem will be hooked and then share the solution right after that
    - while writing the script think of examples that is suitable for your audience,  for example, think how  a 18 year old student would understand  your content better
    - Don’t worry about the competition there maybe other people talking about the same thing, but the way you share it makes it unique and there are people out there who needs to here it from you!
    - You can copy paste the content that is working for others. It’s ok this is how will learn
    - the content is important but the most important thing is how you are doing it, YOUR CONFIDENCE IS THE KEY!
    - the content can be bad but if you deliver it confidently it can become a great content
    - BE AUTHENTIC! this is the second most important thing, be yourself!

7- Make it a loop
    - on TikTok videos can will be playing on repeat so if your video is looped they may watch it twice or more this increase watch time!
    - it is easy to make videos loop
    - First on your script, the last sentence and your first sentence should be content as if they are in one sentence you can do this whit adding: …that’s why… or …so….
    - second while recording you should start with the last sentence of your video first
    - third while editing you cut the first part of the video and move it at the very end the timeline
8- Post Three short videos a day at three different times to find out when your audience is watching the most
9- Do not hesitate and start recoding Now and post them right the way
10- for now quantity over quality
    - so do not over think it just do it!
