## Validating Product Ideas
Customer interviews:
- find people who have the problem your product solves and might be interested in your solution.
- contact and interview. don't mention you're working on a solution though. just ask for pain points. ask questions such as "how often do you have the problem? are you actively looking for a solution? how much is the problem costing you?"

Ask for feedback on your attention engine or through [[cohort challenges to engage customers]].

Survey replies (above 10-30% response rate is good engagement)
