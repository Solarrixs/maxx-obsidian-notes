For every 1% that unemployment exceeds or falls short of full employment, a 2% [[GDP gap]] will exist.

GDP Gap = ([[natural rate of unemployment]] - actual unemployment) $\times$ 2%
- The GDP gap will either be negative or positive

negative GDP gap $\times$ [[potential GDP]] = sacrificed output
positive GDP gap $\times$ [[potential GDP]] = excessive output
