Tax multiplier (T): $-\dfrac{MPS}{MPC}$.

Used whenever there is a change in taxes. Alternate way to calculate the affect of taxes on [[aggregate expenditure]] compared to using the [[keynesian multiplier]].
- Change in [[growth domestic product#real GDP|real GDP]] = $T \times \Delta taxes$

Increases in taxes decreases [[growth domestic product|GDP]] and vice versa.
