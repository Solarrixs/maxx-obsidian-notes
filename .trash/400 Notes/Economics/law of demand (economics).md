As price increases, quantity [[demand (economics)|demand]] decreases, and vice versa.
- Demand is not the same as want. Demand generally decreases due to the lack of ability to support a demand, however, one's want for a certain product might still remain.

Marginal utility gradually decreases with increasing total utility
When we consume more things, our overall satisfaction decreases for the specific thing

Thus, as successive units of an identical good or service are consumed, at some point, the extra satisfaction will begin to decrease. As a result, price will need to decrease in order to entice you to buy more. Therefore, there will be a greater demand at lower prices.
