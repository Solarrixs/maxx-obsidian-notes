A model developed by [[keynesian economic theory]].
Certain things like wages and interest rates does not drop below a certain price level. Prices may drop further but it will take a long time to happen.

## Reasons for Sticky Prices
1. Wage contracts (especially from union contracts) prevent wages from going downwards during a recession
2. Menu costs can be costly if prices drop below some point
3. Minimum wage laws
4. Fear of price wars between companies within an industry
5. Efficiency wages - cutting wages make people resentful cause people to create inefficiencies within a company
