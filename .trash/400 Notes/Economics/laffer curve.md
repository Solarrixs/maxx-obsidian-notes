There is a sweet spot for taxing to generate the most tax revenue. Increasing tax rate too much will lead to people not wanting to be productive and work.
- Cutting marginal tax rates will allow people to spend, save, and invest, which drives [[aggregate demand]] up, leading to productivity gains, thus also leading to [[aggregate supply]].
