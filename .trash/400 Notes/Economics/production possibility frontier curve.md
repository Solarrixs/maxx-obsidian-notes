is used as a model to determine [[opportunity cost]]

if the slope of the PPC is linear, the [[opportunity cost]] was constant.

[[full and under employment]] can be determined by how the points are plotted on a PPC.
- Any point that falls to the right of the curve on a PPC represents [[scarcity (economics)]] and is therefore impossible to have

[[changing the production possibility frontier curve|Production can be increased]] through technology and discovery of new resources.

## Example of a Garden PPC
| Type     | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Corn     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| Tomatoes | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |

This is translated onto a graph. The points plotted provide a production possibility curve - either you get 5 tomatoes and 0 corn or 0 tomatoes and 5 corn, and anything in between, linearly.

The amount of plants that can possibly be planted is limited by [[scarcity (economics)]].

If someone decides to shift their farm to produce from point A to point C, the [[opportunity cost]] is 2 tomato plants but the gain is 2 corn plants.

Maintaining this garden, requires [[factors of production]]: the seeds of the crops, the farmers, and the machinery to plant seeds

## Example of a Job Distribution PPC
| Type               | A   | B   | C   | D   |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service Jobs       | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| Manufacturing Jobs | 12  | 10  | 6   | 0   |

This is translated onto a graph, with a non-linear slope, which shows that the [[opportunity cost]] is not constant. but actually increasing.
- In real world examples, opportunity costs typically increase over time and is not constant, ultimately resulting in a parabolic PPC.

Resources have different values as they are not identical.
- '' Land is not land, and labor is not labor. Resources are not directly interchangeable.
