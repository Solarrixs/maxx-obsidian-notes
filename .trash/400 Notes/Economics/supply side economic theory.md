Due to how the [[laffer curve]] works, less taxes to a certain amount will increase productivity gains and overall increase [[aggregate supply]].

Since both [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand]] shifts right, the new long run aggregate supply will shift right, leading to an overall better and sustainable economy.

Supply siders believe this works because:
1. Cutting taxes increases incentive to work
2. People will save more and invest more money

Criticisms of supply side economic theory:
1. People will work less and choose leisure since people will have more money due to tax cuts
2. [[aggregate supply]] is harder to manipulate than [[aggregate demand]]
