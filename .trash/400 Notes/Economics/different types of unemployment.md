## Frictional
People switching between jobs. Will always occur in society.

## Structural
The skills or a job that people have becomes unnecessary. It's disruptive to society, but historically has been a sign of a dynamic healthy [[economic systems|economy]].

## Cyclical
Sometimes referred to as deficient demand.

Unemployment that results from a downturn in the economy during a recession.

This is extremely important because cyclical unemployment can be widespread and long term.

### Full Employment
Frictional + Structural unemployment is the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. This is why the base unemployment rate is generally 3.5-4.5%.

0% unemployment is impossible due to people constantly switching jobs.
