Formally defined as debt instruments, and is a form of [[security]].

People can buy bonds from people issuing them, which essentially means they are loaning money to institutions, which will pay back [[interest rate]].
- Bonds can be resold by the person or entity that currently holds them. Therefore, there is a large bond market that exists.

Bonds are safer than most other forms of investments because they are at the front of the line for repayment. There is no guarantee of repayment though.
