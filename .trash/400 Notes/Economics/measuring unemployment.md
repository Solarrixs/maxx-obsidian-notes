there are [[different types of unemployment]]

measured using surveys:
1. establishment or payroll survey: asks businesses
2. household survey or CPS current population survey: asks individuals monthly

unemployment % rate = # of unemployed / labor force.
- labor force includes everyone willing and able to work who is 16 or older.

there are some issues with measuring unemployment (see: [[issues with surveys or pulls (government)]]).

Unemployment can be understated:
1. Part time employment is counted the same as full time employment
2. marginally attached workers aren't counted as unemployed. These are workers who haven't looked for work for a month but did try to find work within the last year. This can test for discouraged workers who aren't able to find a job.
3. Movement to inferior jobs

Unemployment can be overstated:
1. Black market employment is hard to track official and instead and individual may be regarded as unemployed
2. People on unemployment benefits sometimes treat it like a paid vacation
