A change in the determinants of investment demand will change the graph of [[investment demand graph]].
- They are also determinants of aggregate demand.

Measuring investment is important as it is calculated in the [[growth domestic product|GDP]]. This is plotted on a investment schedule graph.

A lack of investment can lead to a recession on the [[business cycle]].

Ultimately though, [[investment in the economy is volatile]].

1. Cost of [[consumer and capital goods#capital goods|capital goods]], maintenance, and operating costs
	- ex The [[government]] requires additional training for all heavy machinery operators. This will decrease a company's return on investment due to training costs. Therefore, at a certain expected rate of return, less investment will occur (shift to the left on the [[investment demand graph]]). Therefore, there is a loess of money because fewer investments now have a return on investment (ROI) of at least 10%.
2. Business taxes
	- ex If businesses receive tax cuts, any and all investments will increase (shift to the right on the [[investment demand graph]]).
3. Technological changes
	- ex new efficient machinery will increase return on investment.
4. Stock of [[consumer and capital goods#capital goods|capital goods]] on hand (associated with the [[economic indicator]] [[capacity utilization]])
	- ex Capacity utilization at 70% will result in decreased investment, which reduces the return on investment.
5. Expectations of future businesses
	- ex If banks starting to fail and businesses as a whole aren't doing as good, overall investments will decrease. The opposite is true as well.
