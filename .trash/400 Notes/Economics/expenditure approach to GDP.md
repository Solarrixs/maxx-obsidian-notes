GDP = C + I + G + E (CGIE)

- C: consumption expenditures. Largest portion of the GDP (70%). This includes all household purchases of goods and services, including [[types of goods|durable and non-durable goods]]. The US has the largest economy in the world and consume/spend significantly more than any other country in the world. When the economy falls, it is likely due to less consumption by Americans.
- I: growth private domestic investment. This includes all [[consumer and capital goods#capital goods|capital equipment]], construction projects, and changes in inventory storage. Big inventories typically result in worker layoffs and are a precursor to a bad economy.
- G: [[government]] purchases. Any goods and services bought by the government, including labor and employment. Social capital for roads and bridges are also counted.
- E: net exports. Calculated with: Exports (X) - Imports (M). Negative values result in trade deficits. Under the theory of [[mercantilism]], it is favorable to have more exports than imports. In the US, exports are consistently in trade deficits.

This can be plotted on the [[aggregate expenditure model]].

When people save money, buy imports, or pay taxes, they interfere with the [[aggregate expenditure]], causing it to leak money and lower the overall [[growth domestic product|GDP]].
