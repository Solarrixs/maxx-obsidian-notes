Business cycles are variably dynamic in length of time.

It is made up of 4 features:
1. expansion: increased growth, employment, and efficiency. This typically leads to [[inflation]] and thus less price stability. See [[the four major economic goals]].
2. peak: max growth, employment, and efficiency. Inflation is highest at above 2%.
3. recession: decreased growth and unemployment. Efficiency can both increase or decrease. However, price becomes stable or lowers in inflation.
4. minimum growth, employment, and efficiency. Price is most stable.

## Causes of the Business Cycle
1. Total spending changes ([[keynesian economic theory]]): decreased in total spending leads to deceased output and increased [[measuring unemployment|unemployment]]. This is demand driven.
2. Money creation ([[monetarism economic theory]]): if the [[money supply]] is too great or little, it brings changes to the business cycle. Increased money supply brings expansionary periods.
3. Innovation: new innovations trigger expansionary periods. This is a [[supply side economic theory]].
4. Productivity: greater productivity results in expansion. This is a [[supply side economic theory]].
