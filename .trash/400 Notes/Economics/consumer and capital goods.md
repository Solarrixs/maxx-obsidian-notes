## Consumer Goods
consumer goods are items intended for final usage by the average individual

## Capital Goods
capital goods are items used to produce something else (usually consumer goods)
- capital equipment: are machines and tools not used up in producing a good or service (similar to [[catalysts]]). They are also items for final use by a business.
- intermediate goods: goods that are used to produce something that become part of the final good
- The same item can be both a consumer and capital good, depending on the situation

Typically, a country with higher consumer goods have a better quality of life but a country with higher capital goods have increased production and innovation, which expands the capacity to grow in the future - which overcomes existing levels of [[scarcity (economics)]] and pushes the [[production possibility frontier curve]] rightward.
