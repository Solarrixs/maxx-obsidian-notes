Supply is related with producer behavior: a measure of the **willingness** and **ability** of **producer** to sell in a given **time period**

Opposite of [[demand (economics)]]: as price increases, the quantity increases

Thus, the **law of supply** is that: as price increases, then quantity supplied increases

## Variable and Fixed Inputs
Inputs: anything that goes into the production process (related with [[factors of production]])
- Inputs can be variable: easily changed or attained inputs
- Inputs can be fixed: can't be changed easily

This leads to the **law of diminishing returns**:
- As successive variable inputs are added to some fixed input, eventually a decrease in marginal product will occur. This leads to per unit costs to rise. Therefore, the only reason a producer will produce more is if price rise to cover rising per unit costs.
- This explains the upward sloping nature of the supply curve

## Shirt Manufacturing Graph Example
| Workers | Total Product | Marginal Product | Cost per Shirt |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| 1       | 200           | 200              | .50            |
| 2       | 500           | 200              | .40            |
| 3       | 1000          | 500              | .30            |
| 4       | 1300          | 300              | .31            |
| 5       | 1500          | 200              | .33            |

As productivity decreases after 3 workers, then the cost per shirt begins to rise again.
