The [[production possibility frontier curve]] can be moved rightward:
- improved technology, which reduces the point of [[scarcity (economics)]] (common, most likely occurs in countries producing capital goods)
- discovery of new resources, which reduces the point of [[scarcity (economics)]] (rare)

And also can be moved leftward:
- Loss of resources or labor reduces the potential output due to [[scarcity (economics)]]
