Controlled by the FOMC.

Most used regulation of the [[monetary policy]] by the [[federal reserve]].

Is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge one another on overnight loans (typically to fulfill the [[reserve requirement]]). The federal serve sets a target rate. The higher the federal fund rate is, the less likely banks will take loans from other banks. Therefore, banks will hoard more money to meet the reserve requirement, which drops the [[money supply]].
