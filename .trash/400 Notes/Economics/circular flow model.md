Circular flow model of capitalism highlights the interdependence of households & businesses and their contribution to the resource market & product market
- Land, labor, and capital all stem from the households
- Resource/factor market: households sell, businesses buy
- Product market: businesses sell, households buy

In the center, everyoneâ€™s taxes go to the government while they provide protection, regulation, roads, welfare, etc

Three main economic questions:
1. What mix of goods and services should a country produce?

2. How are goods and services going to be produced?

3. Who are the beneficiaries of what is produced?
	1. ex US: The people who work hard and have valuable skills
