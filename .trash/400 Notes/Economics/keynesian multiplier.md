The change in equilibrium [[growth domestic product#real|real GDP]] that results from any change in aggregate expenditures, then the change will be greater than the change in aggregate expenditure (see: [[aggregate expenditure model]]).
- Multiplier $\times$ change in [[aggregate expenditure]] = change in [[growth domestic product|GDP]].

This is within a closed economy - there is no exports or government involvement (see: [[expenditure approach to GDP]]).

The investment, spending, or government spending multiplier is 1/[[MPS]].
- If given MPC, convert to MPS: MPS = 1 - [[MPC]].

Also see: [[tax multiplier]]
If the [[government]] increases taxes, then consumption will decrease. You can use the multiplier $\times$ change in aggregate expenditure formula.
- ex If government increases taxes by $1000 with a MPC of 0.75, then $750 of consumption will decrease, leading to a decrease in $3000 of real [[national income]] (MPS = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25; 1/0.25 = 4).
