## Change in Demand
a change in demand is the result of a change in a [[determinants of demand]]. This results in a completely new set of behaviors at each price level.
- A change in demand occurs when the entire [[demand curve]] is shifted
- Shift to the right is increased demand, shift to the left is decreased demand

## Change in Quantity Demanded
a change in quantity demanded $(\Delta QD)$ occurs if you move from one point along a [[demand curve]] to another point on a demand curve
- This is caused by a **change in price** of the item, which will always be reflected as a movement along a demand curve

this is a result of either the [[income effect]] and [[substitution effect]]
