1. Par Value: Face value of a [[bonds (economic)|bond]] - typically is the amount borrowed usually. Typically $100 or $1000 minimum
2. Coupon: fixed [[interest rate]]
3. Maturity: date paid back, affected by [[inflation]]

## Yield
Yield is the interest that is currently being paid at the price the bond trades at or was purchased for.
- ex A $1000 bond with a coupon of 5% will lead to a $50 payment yearly until after the maturity date is reached and you get back your initial $1000 as well. However, if the bond is resold for $950, the bond will still pay $50 yearly. This means the yield rate has increased to 5.26%.

Yield = Annual payment/Purchase price $\times$ 100.

The price of bonds and yields are inversely correlated.
