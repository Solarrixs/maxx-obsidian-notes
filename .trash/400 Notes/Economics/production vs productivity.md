Production is output
Productivity is a measure of output per unit of input

New technology facilitates increased productivity, which ultimately increases production

## Productivity
Increasing productivity is highly beneficial to improve production and drive the [[production possibility frontier curve]] forwards

1. Investment in [[consumer and capital goods#capital goods|capital goods]] or human capital (education, food services, shuttle services) increases efficiency
2. Specialization to create an extreme skill in one expertise increases efficiency
3. R&D investment to improve current products, technology ultimately improves

### Example 1
**2019**

| # of Workers | Tons of Coal | Marginal (Extra) Product |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1            | 10           | 10                       |
| 2            | 20           | 10                       |
| 3            | 30           | 10                       |
| 4            | 40           | 10                       |
| 5            | 50           | 10                       |

**2020**

| # of Workers | # of Coal | Marginal (Extra) Product |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 1            | 10        | 10                       |
| 2            | 20        | 10                       |
| 3            | 30        | 10                       |
| 4            | 40        | 10                       |
| 5            | 50        | 10                       |
| 6            | 60        | 10                       |

Since the marginal product of both years remains the same, production has increased but productivity haven't.

### Example 2
**2021**

| # of Workers | Tons of Coal | Marginal (Extra) Product |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1            | 10           | 10                       |
| 2            | 20           | 10                       |
| 3            | 30           | 10                       |
| 4            | 40           | 10                       |
| 5            | 50           | 10                       |

**2022**

| # of Workers | # of Coal | Marginal (Extra) Product |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 1            | 10        | 10                       |
| 2            | 25        | 15                       |
| 3            | 45        | 20                       |
| 4            | 70        | 25                       |

Both production and productivity has increased.
