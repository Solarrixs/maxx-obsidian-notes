Only a fraction of the actual [[money supply]] is held as currency on reserve.

Actual Reserves - Required Reserves = Excess Reserves
- ex Depositing $100 in cash to a checking account with a [[reserve requirement]] of 40% are required to keep 40% of your cash in the bank vault or in the federal reserve account.

This creates a money multiplier effect: money multiplier = 1/(Reserve Ratio)
- For the money multiplier to work to its maximum efficiency, all loans from excess reserves must find their way into a different bank and be loaned out. All transactions also have to be checkable deposits.

Therefore, maximum money creation = money multiplier $\times$ excess reserves

Maximum money creation + original money supply = new money supply
