## Growth
the ability to produce greater amounts of goods and services (see: [[growth domestic product]])
a shift of a [[production possibility frontier curve|PPC]] to the right indicates growth

## Full Employment
ideally, everyone would be employed, leading to maximum [[production vs productivity|productivity]]
- ex In large countries like the US, [[different types of unemployment#Full Employment|full employment rate]] is generally 3.5-4.5% of unemployment.

this would mean on a [[production possibility frontier curve|PPC]] graph, production will be on the curve instead of under the graph

## Price Stability
prices should not increase or decrease significantly (see: [[inflation]], [[deflation]])

[[inflation]] annually should not be over 2% for the US, and there should not be no deflation
- [[inflation]] is bad because your money is less valuable than it once was
- deflation is bad because the cost of a loan will remain constant but since money is worth more, you need to pay more money for your loan

## Efficiency
efficiency of labor increase growth, shifts the [[production possibility frontier curve|PPC]] to the right, and increases the [[growth domestic product]]
see: [[production vs productivity#productivity|productivity]]

## Complimentary or Conflicting Goals
increase efficiency means increasing growth are usually complementary goals (there are some exceptions)

significant growth in the economy usually results in full employment
- however, significant growth in the economy can cause price instability (fast growth typically generates [[inflation]])

## Socioeconomic Goals
there are new recent goals developed by [[progressives]] in recent times
economic justice, environmental protection, and economic equity
- ex [[Environmental Protection Agency]]
