$P = \dfrac{nM_{w}\mu^2}{3v}$

Pressure in [[ideal gases]] depends on:
- speed - higher [[root mean square speed]] is higher collisional frequency
- moles of molecules - more moles means more collisions
- volume of container - less volume means more collisions
- molecular weights - more mass means more impact of collisions

Pressure is measured in:
1 standard atmosphere = 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 760 torr = 101.3kPa
