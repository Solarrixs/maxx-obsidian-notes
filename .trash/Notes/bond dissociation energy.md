Bond dissociation energy is the energy released by bonds if broken.
- Increases with higher electronegativity

Can be calculated using the [[heat of reaction]]:
$\Delta H_{rxn} = \Sigma n \Delta H \text{ (bonds broken - bonds formed)}$
- Essentially becomes bonds of reactants - bonds of products
- Scales with moles
