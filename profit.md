Total economic profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. So if a business produces quantity $q$, profit is written as:
$\pi = TR(q) - TC(q)$, where $TC(q) = FC + VC(q)$ and $TR(q) = P \times q$

However, economic cost also includes implicit [[opportunity cost]], including the opportunity cost of forgone wages and forgone itnerest.
