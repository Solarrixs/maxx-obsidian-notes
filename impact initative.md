I'm Tensae Yohannes, the CEO of Impact Initiative, and I'm excited to finally have the chance to meet all of you. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as an investment banking summer analyst at Morgan Stanley's Global Technology Group in NYC, and I'll be returning this summer. I'm currently a junior at the University of Washington, and a fun fact about me is that I've been a die-hard Knicks fan since I was a kid!

I’m Ally Tutay, the Chief Consulting Officer of Impact Initiative — so excited to get started and meet you all! This past summer, I worked at BCG NYC as a GFL Summer Associate and I’ll be returning next summer as well. I’m a junior at Smith College and a fun fact about me is I’ve lived in 4 different countries. Don’t hesitate to slack me about anything!

I’m Ryan Lowe, one of the Executive Directors of Mentorship in Finance. I’m a junior at Baruch College living in NYC. Last summer, I interned at BNY Mellon within Corporate Finance. This winter, I’ll be at Deloitte working within M&A and next summer at Goldman Sachs within Private Wealth Management.

I’m Cullen Scott, an Executive Director of Mentorship in Finance, and a junior at Wharton. I am very excited to start working with you all! Last summer, I had the opportunity to work as a S&T intern at TD Cowen. I will be joining Evercore next summer as a generalist in their investment banking division. A fun fact about me is that I have 3 older brothers. Please feel free to reach out about anything!
