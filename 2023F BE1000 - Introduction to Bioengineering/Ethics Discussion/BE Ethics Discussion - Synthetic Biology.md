- Penn’s President Amy Gutmann served as the Chair of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, which produced a series of reports and policy papers from 2009-2017. Listen to or read the transcript of the podcast, “Ethically Sound: Bioethics for Every Generation,” and take notes on how Gutmann describes the concepts of democratic deliberation and ethics education. How does Gutmann describe the concepts of democratic deliberation and ethics education?

- In 2015, a group of 18 bioengineering researchers published a policy piece in Science in which they described their pioneering work with CRISPR-Cas9 in its societal context. As you read this article, pay attention to how they describe the technology, its current and potential applications, and their recommendations for public policy. Identify a compelling quote and be prepared to discuss it with the class.  What resonated with you about that quote?  What did you find compelling (or not) about the Science article and why?
