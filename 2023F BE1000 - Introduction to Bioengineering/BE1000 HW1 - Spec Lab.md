1. The stock solution was prepared at $0.03g/L$, while the molecular weight is $332.31g/mol$. That means $\dfrac{0.03g}{332.31g/mol} = 0.0000902772 \text{mol}$. Using the formula to calculate molarity, which is $M = \dfrac{mol}{L}$,  we get $\dfrac{0.0000902772}{1}$ = $0.0000902772\text{ M}$. After converting from $M \text{ to } \mu M$, we get $90.2772 \mu M$.

2. Given final diluted concentrations in $\mu M$:
	1. 25 - $275\mu L$ of stock and $725\mu L$ of water.
	2. 20 - $220\mu L$ of stock and $780\mu L$ of water.
	3. 15 - $165\mu L$ of stock and $835\mu L$ of water.
	4. 10 - $110\mu L$ of stock and $840\mu L$ of water.
	5. 5 - $55\mu L$ of stock and $945\mu L$ of water.

3. ! For the $10\mu M$ sample, we needed $110\mu L$ of stock and $840\mu L$ of water. Then, for the $1000\mu L$ pipette for water, the number was 840. For the $200\mu L$ pipette for the stock solution, the number was 110.
