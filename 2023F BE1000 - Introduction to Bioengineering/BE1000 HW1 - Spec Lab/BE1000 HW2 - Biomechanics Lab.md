1. Calculate the average Elastic modulus for each of the four different materials that were tested, as well as the standard deviation. Please use units of GPa for the Elastic modulus.
2. Create a bar plot that compares the Elastic modulus of the four different materials that were tested. Be sure to include error bars (standard deviations).
3. What material has an elastic modulus that is closest to bone? The elastic modulus of bone is 7-30 GPa.
4. Which material exhibited the greatest displacement before fracture/failure?
5. Which material fractured/failed under the least amount of force?
