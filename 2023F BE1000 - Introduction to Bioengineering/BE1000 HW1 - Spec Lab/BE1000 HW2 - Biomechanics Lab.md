1. Calculate the average Elastic modulus for each of the four different materials that were tested, as well as the standard deviation. Please use units of GPa for the Elastic modulus.

1. Create a bar plot that compares the Elastic modulus of the four different materials that were tested. Be sure to include error bars (standard deviations).

1. What material has an elastic modulus that is closest to bone? The elastic modulus of bone is 7-30 GPa.
	1. PLA had an average elastic modulus of 2.7988 GPa, which is the closest to bone out of all the materials (even though it really isn't that similar).

3. Which material exhibited the greatest displacement before fracture/failure?
	1. Polyethylene terephthalate displaced around 0.5-1mm more than acrylic so Polyethylene terephthalate exhibited the greatest displacement before failure, with acrylic being a close second.

5. Which material fractured/failed under the least amount of force?
	1. Medium Density Fibreboard
