1. Compared to other majors, what opportunities are available to BE majors in terms of summer internships next year? For example CS students get the obvious FANG. I feel like BE is limited to just research or pharma, both of which is what I don't want to do.
	1. What I really want to do is biotech startups, but I feel like you don't get to study biotech until 3rd year, and you don't have any courses in technology, and startup and other business related skills you can't do unless you take Wharton courses which takes time away from your major

3. The problem is that we only learn BE1000 by the end of our first year, while CS gets 1200, 1600, 1210, etc. Ours is just an intro while they get to understand a lot about CS.

4. At other schools, BE majors are slotted into dual degrees, such as Duke's CS + BioE to allow "students interested in careers in biotechnology"

5. Is there anyway I can "concentrate" or minor in in CS + EENT + Finance + Neuroengineering?
