[[Price elasticity of demand]] $(E_{D})$ = $\dfrac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}} < 1$

Price increases lead to larger changes in quantity demanded. That means higher prices lead to more total revenue if demand is inelastic.

There is a case of perfectly inelastic demand: if the [[demand curve]] is vertical.
