Enthalpy = $\Delta H$ = $\delta q_{p}$ = [[heat]] change (or energy flow as heat) in J.
- It is a [[path-independent function|state function]]

If $\delta q_{p} < 0$, it is an exothermic reaction, so $H_{\text{product}} < H_{\text{reactants}}$.

Enthalpy is different from [[energy]] as it also includes the energy of interaction with the environment.
- $\Delta H = \Delta E + P\Delta V = nC_{p}\Delta T = \delta q_{p}$ at constant [[ideal gas pressure|pressure]].

The $\Delta H$ of a chemical reaction scales 1:1 with the moles of the reaction. If the reaction is reversed, flip the sign of $\Delta H$.
