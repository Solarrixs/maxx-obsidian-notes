Assumptions:
1. Volume of gas particles are 0 - infinite distance between particles
2. Perfectly elastic collisions lead to no loss in [[energy]] upon collisions with other particles or the wall
3. No intermolecular forces between particles
4. Motion ([[kinetic energy]]) is random proportion to the temperature of the gas
