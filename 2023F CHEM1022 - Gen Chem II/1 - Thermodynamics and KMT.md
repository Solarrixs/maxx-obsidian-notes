# Thermodynamics
How do we know if a chemical reaction will proceed to finalization? This science is called [[thermodynamics]].

Each reaction will release or absorb [[energy]] to either do [[work]] or [[heat]]. Energy is a [[path-independent function]] while work or heat is a [[path-dependent function]] function.

A similar concept to heat you should know is [[heat capacity]].

# Ideal Gases & Kinetic Molecular Theory
[[ideal gases|Ideal gases]] follow certain [[ideal gas assumptions]] that always follows the [[ideal gas law]]. The [[kinetic energy]] of ideal gases only depend on temperature. However, the [[root mean square speed]] of a gas depend on temperature and molar mass.

In a cylinder, ideal gases also exert a [[ideal gas pressure|pressure]].

# Enthalpy
The heat change at constant pressure is [[enthalpy]].

Enthalpy can be measured in coffee cup and bomb calorimeters.

| Coffee Cup | Bomb |
| --- | --- |
| Constant Pressure | Constant Volume |
| Surroundings is water | Surroundings is water + bomb |
| $-q_{\text{rxn}} = q_{\text{water}}$ | $-q_{\text{rxn}} = q_{\text{water}}+q_{\text{bomb}}$ |
| $q=mC\Delta T$ | $q=C\Delta T$ |
