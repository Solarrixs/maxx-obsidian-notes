# Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics determines whether a chemical equation will proceed through the relationship of heat and energy:
- The reaction has to be favorable - spontaneous or energetically favorable 
- A chemical equation would also be either exothermic or endothermic

Potential energy + Kinetic energy = Total energy $(\Delta E)$
- Potential energy is the chemical bonding
- Kinetic energy is the atom's motion

The energy is either released is the capacity to do:
- Work (w): $\delta w = F \times \Delta d$
- Heat (q): $\delta q = nC \times \Delta T$

Path-independent (state) functions (in uppercase) does not depend on the path taken
- ex $\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial}$

Path-dependent functions depend on the path taken
- ex Heat, work

$\Delta E = \delta q + \delta w$
- Total energy (a state function) is the sum of heat and work (path-dependent functions)
- Energy of system + Energy of surrounding = 0

$\delta q$ (either positive or negative):
- $n\frac{3}{2}R\Delta T$ for heating at constant pressure (in moveable containers)
- $n\frac{5}{2}R\Delta T$ for heating at non-constant pressure (in rigid containers)

$\delta w$ (either positive or negative):
- $P\Delta V$
- 0 in rigid container since volume doesn't change
- Convert answer from $Latm$ to $J$ by multiplying by $101.3$

Work is ordered molecular motion:
- work > 0 if the work is done on the system by the surroundings (compression or gas absorbing work, leading to energy gained)
- work < 0 if the work is done on the surroundings by the system (expansion or gas doing work, leading to energy lost)

Heat is random molecular motion:
- heat > 0 if the system gains heat
- heat < 0 if the system loses heat

## Ideal Gases
$PV = nRT$
- $R$ = 0.08206 Latm/molK = 8.314 J/molK
- 1 Latm = 101.3J

# Kinetic Molecular Theory
Assumptions:
1. Volume of gas particles are 0 - infinite distance between particles
2. Perfectly elastic collisions lead to no loss in energy upon collisions with other particles or the wall
3. No intermolecular forces between particles
4. Motion (KE) is random proportion to the temperature of the gas

$KE_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{3}{2}RTn$
- This is only for ideal gases
- $\Delta KE = \dfrac{3}{2}R\Delta Tn$
- $\Delta T = \frac{RV}{nR}$

Heat capacity is the minimum amount of heat to increase the temperature by 1 Kelvin of a 1 mol substance at constant volume
