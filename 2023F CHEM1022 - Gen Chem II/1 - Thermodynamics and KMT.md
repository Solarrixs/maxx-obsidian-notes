# Thermodynamics
How do we know if a chemical reaction will proceed to finalization? This science is called [[thermodynamics]].

Each reaction will release or absorb [[energy]] to either do [[work]] or [[heat]]. Energy is a [[path-independent function]] while work or heat is a [[path-dependent function]] function.

A similar concept to heat you should know is [[heat capacity]].

# Ideal Gases & Kinetic Molecular Theory
[[ideal gases|Ideal gases]] follow certain [[ideal gas assumptions]] that always follows the [[ideal gas law]]. The [[kinetic energy]] of ideal gases only depend on temperature. However, the [[root mean square speed]] of a gas depend on temperature and molar mass.

In a cylinder, ideal gases also exert a [[ideal gas pressure|pressure]].
