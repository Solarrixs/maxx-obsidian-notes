Heat is random molecular motion, represented by $\delta q = nC \times \Delta T$
- $n\frac{3}{2}R\Delta T$ for heating at **constant pressure** (in moveable containers)
- $n\frac{5}{2}R\Delta T$ for heating at **non-constant pressure** (in rigid containers)


$\delta q$ is **positive** if the system gains heat and **negative** if the system loses heat.
