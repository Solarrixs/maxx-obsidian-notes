[[ideal gases|Ideal gases]] have an average root mean square speed, calculated with this equation:
$\mu_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{3RTn}{M_{w}}}$ (in m/s).

From this equation, you can see that root mean square speed depends on molar mass and temperature.
- !  Divide the molar mass by 1000 beforehand to get the correct units!
- Use R = 8.314
