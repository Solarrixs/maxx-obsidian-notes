Entropy $\Delta S$ measures disorder and is a [[path-independent function|state function]] represented by:
$\Delta S = nC_{p}\ln(\frac{Tf}{Ti})$
$\Delta S_{\text{surr}} = -\frac{\Delta H}{T}$
$\Delta S = \Delta S_{\text{sys}} + \Delta S_{\text{surrounding}} > 0$
- $\Delta S_{\text{sys}}$ is exothermic ($+\frac{J}{K}$) and $\Delta S_{\text{surrounding}}$ is endothermic ($-\frac{J}{K}$). This is [[heat]] flow.
- $+ \Delta S$ means increasing disorder

Based on the 2nd law of [[thermodynamics]], nature goes to the most probable state available to it (which is increasing entropy).

$\Delta S$ increases as there are more atoms in a molecule.
$\Delta S$ increases as there is a higher [[kinetic energy]] because temperature change affects $\Delta S$.
