Energy $(\Delta E)$ is released or absorbed from chemical reactions.
- Energy of system (such as the chemical reaction) + Energy of surroundings = 0

Potential energy + Kinetic energy = Total energy $(\Delta E)$
- Potential energy is the chemical bonding
- Kinetic energy is the atom's random motion

The released energy has the capacity to do either [[work]] or [[heat]] and is represented by this equation: $\Delta E = \delta q + \delta w$
