Heat capacity (C) = $\dfrac{J}{C}$

Specific heat capacity (C) = $\dfrac{J}{gC}$

Heat capacity is the minimum amount of [[heat]] units to increase the temperature of a body by 1 degree.

Specific heat capacity is the heat required to increase the temperature of 1 mol of substance by 1 degree.

Heat capacity for [[ideal gases]] is different under constant pressure and under constant volume (non-constant pressure).
