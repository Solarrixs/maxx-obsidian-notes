Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.

# Kinetic Energy in Ideal Gases
In [[ideal gases]], you can find the average kinetic energy of a gas with this formula: $KE_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{3}{2}RTn$ (in joules).

From this equation, you can see that the $KE$ of ideal gases only depend on temperature.

The change in kinetic energy can be found using: $\Delta KE = \dfrac{3}{2}R\Delta Tn$
