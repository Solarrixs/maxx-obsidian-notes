Work is ordered molecular motion, represented by $\delta w = F \times \Delta d$ or $P\Delta V$ (in cylinders).
- $\delta w = 0$ in rigid container since volume doesn't change and becomes 0
- Convert answer from $Latm$ to $J$ by multiplying by $101.3$

$\delta w$ is **positive** if work is being done on the system (compression or energy gained) and **negative** if work is done on the surroundings (expansion or energy lost).
