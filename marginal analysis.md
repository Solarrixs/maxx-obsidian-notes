Marginal analysis compares [[marginal revenue]] and [[marginal cost]] instead of using [[isoprofit curve|isoprofit curves]].

Producing more units of a good affects revenue in 2 ways:
1. Quantity effect: $q$ increases, increasing revenue
2. Price effect: As $q$ increases, $p$ (price) must lower due to downward sloping demand, reducing revenue

Therefore, quantity effect - price effect = change in total revenue, or the [[marginal revenue]].

- ex The MR for the following case: $100 and 20 units sold, then $99 and 21 units sold, is $78. This is calculated by $\frac{99 \times 21 - 100\times 20}{21-20}$

Because a firm's total revenue increases [[marginal revenue]] > [[marginal cost]], the firm reaches maximum [[profit]] when $MR=MC$.
